S Jose,"The map illustrates Meadowside village and Fonton and how they have developed over the years 1962, 1985 and presently.&lt;br&gt;Overall, Meadowside village has become bigger and is now Meadowside suburb as it has merged with Fonton. There are new roads connecting the two villages and new buildings have been built. &lt;br&gt;In 1962, Meadowside village and Fonton lie on either side not connected by road or rail. But it is visible that Fonton had a rail running through it from the north to the east. On the other hand, Meadowside village had a small road passing through it; it started in the north and moved to the west.&lt;br&gt;As we move to 1985, we can see that Meadowside village has been expanded and now facilitates a housing estate along with a leisure complex beside it. Across the road that runs through the village which was previously only a small road and is now a main road, we are able to notice the presence of a superstore on the south of the residential area which first appeared in 1985. It is noticeable that there is a road that passes through the village and Fonton from the west to east.&lt;br&gt;In terms of now, Meadowside is now a suburb. A new rail has emerged towards the east starting from a station located in the center of the two places. Just above the station is where the hotel is situated. Below the station, we can see the business park as well.&lt;br&gt;Hi can you please correct my mistakes and let me know if there is anything I can do to make this better. And what is a score that I can expect?&lt;br&gt;The maps presents the development of the urbanization in Meodowside village and the nearest located town Fonton, from year 1962.&lt;br&gt;
Meodowside and Fonton started far apart from eachother, but have gradually been structured over time into a bigger town with linking roads, trainroad tracks, and new-built housing. &lt;br&gt;In 1962 Meodowside village was situated singularly, without any connection to Fonton. The small village had a smaller road passing through. Fonton had only a trainway track going through town. &lt;br&gt;Under the period up until 1985, there was a significant change. Looking at the middle map, Meodowside has developed to a larger village and buildings as the housing estate and a superstore were constructed in additional.&lt;br&gt;
 The small road was built wider and another linking road was shaped between the town and village.&lt;br&gt;After the year 1985, the infrastructure changed massively. A hotel with a nearby trainstation and a business park have been reinforced. Comparing now to 1962 shows a big difference and total connection creating a town out  of the the prior village and town. &lt;br&gt;172 words&lt;br&gt;
32 minutes&lt;br&gt;The map illustrates the information about the development of Meadowside and Fonton over three periods of time. Overall, it can be seen from the map that there was no development of Meadowside and Fonton in 1962. Meanwhile, in the present, there are so many facilities, including housing estate, superstore, hotel, train station and business park.&lt;br&gt;Initially, in 1962, there was no development in the landscape in the middle of area. There is only a road ran through Meadowside village and a railway in Fonton as well. Moreover, in 1985, a housing estate, superstore and leisure complex were built in Meadowside village. The road was upgraded to concrete road and connected to Fonton. Additionally, Fonton area was bigger than the 1962.&lt;br&gt;In the present, a hotel, train station and business park is built between Meadowside suburbs and Fonton. In addition, train station is connected to Fonton. Meadowside suburbs and Fonton area have merged into one major landscape.&lt;br&gt;Three maps are shown, depicting the composition of Meadowside village and the neighbouring town of Fonton in 1962, 1985, and in the present.&lt;br&gt;Overall, one can retrace the development and growth of the two communities with first, the building of a bigger and connecting road through Meadowside village into an enlarged Fonton and second, the incorporation into one continuously populated area with new shared infrastructures.&lt;br&gt;By 1985, the previously smaller road through Meadowside village had been rebuilt into a larger road, including a new section dividing from its curved path, leading straight into the town of Fonton. Further infrastructural changes have only been made after 1985. Nowadays, a novel railway terminus is situated in the area between the two communities, that provides access to the Fonton railway.&lt;br&gt;In terms of other buildings, both communities had grown considerably by 1985, with the map illustrating a housing estate, leisure complex and superstore located within Meadowside village. Since then, this housing estate has increased further, and a hotel and business park have been built next to the new station, centered in between the once two communities.&lt;br&gt;
connecting the formerly beforehand separate communities.&lt;br&gt;broo this is a 9.5 score band&lt;br&gt;i love u lizz&lt;br&gt;The maps depict both Meadowside village and Fonton town in their present and past appearances, dating back to 1985 and 1962.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be clearly seen that not only have the town and village been developed, they are also connected to each other among the considered periods. Similarly, a number of infrastructures have been developed.&lt;br&gt;In 1962, Fonton and Meadowside were ordinary towns and villages with no interconnection, but they had their own roots. In Meadowside village, there was a road expanding to the south-west of the village and north, and Fonton had a rail road running in the middle of the town. By the year 1985, for the first time, the village and the town had joined each other with the construction of a road. Furthermore, in Meadowside Village, there had been built a supermarket, a housing state, and a leisure complex to the southern part, to the western part, and to the northern part, respectively.&lt;br&gt;By present, both Meadowside village and Fonton town have been totally connected. There is a station right in the middle of town, a hotel to the north, and a business park to the south. And there is a noticeable extension of the railway to the middle of the town. Furthermore, the name of the village has been changed to Meadowside Suburs.&lt;br&gt;The maps show the development projects taking place in both Meadowside Village and Fonton, which is a neighboring town, from 1962 to the present era. Overall, there were significant changes in both towns, Meadowside village were extended in size and has become a Surber area.  There is some infrastructure, a housing estate, and a leisure complex. Meadowside Village is connected by a main road to the Fonton.&lt;br&gt;
In 1992, both Meadowside Village and Fonton Town were completely separated. There is a railway track in Fonton Town, which runs through its North side, and a road in Meadowside Village which runs from its west side.&lt;br&gt;
In 1985, some changes were made in Meadowside Village. An estate housing and a complex leisure wade made on its North side and a superstore at its south side. Moreover, Meadowside Village was extended by a main road, which connect it to Fonton Town directly.&lt;br&gt;
At that present time, another railway track has been made, which comes from the Western side of Fonton Town. There is also a station made there. A business park has been constructed on the opposite side of the railway station. Besides this, a hotel has been constructed here. Shortly, it can be said that these two towns are completely merged.&lt;br&gt;The maps illustrate the developments that took place in the Meadowside village and its neighbouring town, Fonton since 1962. There are 3 maps and they show the same region across 3 different dates (1962, 1985, and current). &lt;br&gt;Overall, initially Fonton Town appears considerably larger than Meadowside village but as time passed, the meadowside village grew in size. It can be observed that Meadowside village had more changes compared to Fonton town. Currently, Meadowside village and Fonton Town are interlinked with many buildings and roads.&lt;br&gt;In 1962, Meadowside village had only one road passing through it which ran from the west to north while Fonton had a railway line from north to the east. The two did not have any interlinks between them for commute. By 1985 however, Meadowside village grew rapidly, with the road being expanded and a new section of road had been laid out to reach Fonton Town. The village had a housing estate, leisure complex, and a super-store.&lt;br&gt;Currently, Meadowside Village has transformed into Meadowside Suburbs and a new railway line has been established in Fonton Town which ends in a station situated nearly in the centre of the two localities. The Hotel lies to the north of the station compared to the business park being located in the south. The business park can be accessed from the road linking Meadowside suburbs and Fonton Town.&lt;br&gt;The maps provide information about two neighbouring settlements, Meadowside(a village) and Fonton(a town), which have undergone development in the space of 60years.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, there has been development in the infrastructure, housing and transport systems in both Meadowside and Fonton, and the two areas have increased in size over the years.&lt;br&gt;Notably, there was a huge difference in both the size of Meadowside and its infrastructures between 1962 to 1985 as housing estate, leisure complex and super store were all constructed in 1985 as opposed to the lack of these facilities in 1962 in the village. In the same period, Fonton town was developed with increased size and construction of road passing from the southeast to the southwest, connecting Meadowside and Fonton together.&lt;br&gt;At the moment, both Meadowside and Fonton has been transformed with amenities such as station, business park and a hotel which serve both the suburb and the town. &lt;br&gt;Impressively, while Meadowside was merely a village up till 1985, it is now a suburb area. Also, Fonton town and Meadowside are now connected together as their sizes have increased to joining each other.&lt;br&gt;you need to describe the map. stating the location of the buildings developed using the map axis will be better..&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I hope you are doing great on your job. I just want to know that if you have released any updated article for IELTS writing recently as I believe that structure of IELTS writing is modernized by the changes of time. Thank you so much in advance for your response.&lt;br&gt;The writing test hasn’t changed. The format is the same as it always was. The marking is the same. The techniques are the same. Nothing has changed.&lt;br&gt;Thank you for this update&lt;br&gt;You’re welcome 🙂&lt;br&gt;The map illustrate the change that foncton and meadowside village went through in three time periods (1962, 1985 and the present).&lt;br&gt;Overall, the two neighbors used to be separate with no road or railway connection whatsoever, the two entities managed to grow over time, first to be linked with a road and merged at the end with new different infrastructure facilities.&lt;br&gt;in 1962, Meadowside village had only one small road coming from the west of the village and heading north. Meanwhile, foncton had a railway coming from the north, passing through the city and going west.&lt;br&gt;in 1985, the only road in Meadowise village got increased with an extention linking to it’s neighboring village and going east.Furthermore, a housing estate and a leisure complex were builled north of the West-East road, and a superstore was constructed on the south side of the that road.&lt;br&gt;Currently, Meadowside village name changed to Meadowside suburbs as it merged with foncton, a new business park was constructed south to the East-west road, a new train station was build at the center of the merging neighbors with a new railroad linked to the old one, north of it, a hotel was build.&lt;br&gt;The maps illustrate the progress occurred in Meadowside village and its neighbor, Fonton in three different time periods. &lt;br&gt;Overall, there were significant changes clearly seen in these two areas, one of which is their merging at present.&lt;br&gt;In detail, both Meadowside and Fonton were separated in 1962. The foremost was still a small village with steep road that passed from north to west. The latter, on the other hand was larger in size with rail ran through north to east.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, in 1985 both towns increased their land areas. There were leisure complex, superstore and housing built in Meadowside. Moreover, the steep road was converted into wider roads, one of which was extended to Fonton. &lt;br&gt;At present, Meadowside village which is now a suburb is combined with Fonton. Hotel and station has been established in the eastern side with newly built business park adjacent to the main road connected to Fonton. Alternatively, Fonton formed additional railway across west nearby suburb.&lt;br&gt;This map illustrates how Meadowside village and Fonton , which is neighbour town, have developed over three different times (1982, 1985 and now).&lt;br&gt;
Now Meadowside village is grown much more than 1982, it is merge with Fonton  and grown significate infrastructure,&lt;br&gt;
 1962, this two village were completely separated. There where no rail and Road transportation, they didn’t have any kind of communication. They  was only road from west.&lt;br&gt;
1985, there was growth in Meadowside village, there was Leisure Complex, Housing Estate in west. Super Store in south. Small road converted to main road and also extended to Fonton has also developed.&lt;br&gt;
Now, they are now connected through subways and fonton is now joined .They are more developed. Railways are built in west and run in fonton where the station are built. To north side of the station, a hotel is construction and opposite the station .  There is the business park built in south.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz !&lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much for sharing with us such a well-explained essay.&lt;br&gt;
I found your website veru useful.  I will take IELTS exam in the coming month and I will inform my score with you.&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
Anvar&lt;br&gt;Good luck!&lt;br&gt;The way you explain is extremely beautiful like you. And apologies if i am crossing my limit but your smile could make anyone’s day. Thank you for providing all the information regarding task 1 and 2. Keep smiling.&lt;br&gt;That’s a lovely comment. Thank you. I’m glad my lessons are useful 🙂&lt;br&gt;Are you briliant teacher&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;you are really very good person and Don’t forget keep always smiling 😊&lt;br&gt;🙂&lt;br&gt;The map illustrates the meadowside village and Fonton which are the neighbouring towns, have developed over the different time periods from 1962, 1985 and the present era.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the Meadowside village developed their infrastructure which includes transportation, buildings, hotels etc and connected with the Fonton town.&lt;br&gt;In 1962, both the villages Fonton and Meadowside were not developed as there was no means of transportation between these two places. While Fonton had a railway line running from the north to eastern side of the village. Whereas Meadowside had a small road running from the northern part to western side of the village.&lt;br&gt;In 1985, there has been considerable changes in both the villages, especially in Meadowside village. The small road which was running from north towards the western part of the region had been converted into a highway road and the southern part of this road were merged with another road line which connects to Fonton village. Since then travelling between two villages became more convenient. Moreove in Meadowside village three important landmarks were added to their infrastructure, the Leisure complex in the western part, Housing estate in the eastern side and Super store at the southern area of the village.&lt;br&gt;At present both the villages were developed by improving the mode of transportation, as new connection railway lines were constructed from the western part of Fonton towards the centre location between two villages. To enhance the tourist economy of this area, they built a hotel behind the railway station and the business park on the opposite side of the station towards the south.&lt;br&gt;The map compares the development of Meadowside Village and its neighboring town Fonton throughout three periodical times (1962, 1985, and present time). Overall, the size area of the village and the town have increased and both areas become one union with Meadownside become a suburb area under Fonton administration. There are also developments in infrastructures such as roads, railways, housing, and business center.&lt;br&gt;
In initial year, Meadowside was only a small village with a small road crossing through the village. Located in the east of the village, there was Fonton, a neighboring town with railway running through it. However, there was no road that is channeling both areas.&lt;br&gt;
In 1985, the size of both areas increased. The big road was built in this year, being the hub between the village and the town. There were also a development in infrastructure, as housing estate, leisure complex, and superstore were built in Meadowside village.&lt;br&gt;
In present time, these two areas eventually merge as one, results in Meadowside became a suburb under Fonton town. They also built some facilities in area between Fonton town and the suburbs, such as hotel and business park. The railway line which once was only running through Fonton now extends to Meadowside as a new station was built around there.&lt;br&gt;The maps indicate the developments of a village called Meadowside and of a near town called Fonton, over a period started in 1962.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be seen that over the period in question the village and the town were expanded with the addition of a motorway and some facilities. Nowadays, Fonton and Meadowside are connected to each other.&lt;br&gt;In 1962 the village covered a small area and was crossed by a small street. In the following thirteen years it was improved, with the additions of a leisure complex, a housing estate and a super-store. Also Fonton was expanded and the two sites, in 1985, were connected with a motorway, which crossed both of them, from west to east. &lt;br&gt;Now, Meadowside and Fonton share only one area. To the west, there are Meadowside suburbs and to the east there is Fonton. The most noticeable additions are the hotel which is collocated between them in the north of the area, the station, built along the motorway and the business park.&lt;br&gt;Keep up the good job ✊Your explanation is liked me 😉&lt;br&gt;The rendered map illustrates the information about the improvments in town namely frenton in 32 years between 1990 to 2012.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be clearly seen from the map that there were tremendous changes after three decades in frenton. Se buldings had been improved.&lt;br&gt;
At the outset , school and library were only buildings which stay unchanged and in west side of high street . Trees were cut down to set up a techpark in left bottom side of town, further more , there was a bank beside the school was converted to restaurant . Hospital in the centre had been axpanded .&lt;br&gt;
Proceeding further , bottom playing feild with trees was demolished in order to make blocks of flates , new flats also opened alongside high street . Houses were changed to flats. There were cafe and park in east side of town which were improved into hotel and golf course . Theatre and shops  were modernized in cimema as well as supermarket in last year&lt;br&gt;Hey Liz, i just want to know that can we write things in brackets as you have done in introduction, is it accepted in ielts.&lt;br&gt;Yes, of course. It’s 100% fine and in fact very useful for Writing Task 1. However, don’t overuse them. You need to vary the way you present data. They are mainly useful for line graphs, bar charts, tables and pie charts.&lt;br&gt;The map shows the different development for three years (1962,1985 and currently) in Meadowside village and Foton, a neighbouring town.&lt;br&gt;In general, the small road was replaced by big two main roads. One of them running through the Meadoside village and the other crossing the south-east of Foton. The two states have been together in the present and the size of the place was increased. There are more buildings were constructed during the three years.&lt;br&gt;In 1962, the village was spirited from the other. Also, there were no buildings and connecting the main road between them. The size of tow places was small. However, Foton was bigger than the village.&lt;br&gt;In 1985, Meadowside village constructed by lot of buildings such as ( i can’t see the names)&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, Foton remains the same thing without any buildings except the size of the place which has been increased during the period.&lt;br&gt;In the present, the two places become bigger together and the have been untied by a big road accessing the place from the southeast to the southwest. And the other one from the north ending with the previous road. Between the main roads in. northeast there has been built a hotel and a station. So the number of entertainment buildings has been increased.&lt;br&gt;24 min&lt;br&gt;Hi, Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Hope you are safe. I have a doubt about your writing task 1 practise charts.&lt;br&gt;Which tense to use for the map “an island before and after the construction of some tourist facilities”?&lt;br&gt;It would depend on the fixed date. If the before date is in the past, you use past tense. If the after date is in our current past, you use past tense. However, if it is in our future, you use the future forms. English grammar rules apply as normal to IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Thank you, Liz, but there are no dates in the question only before and after.  That’s why I’m confused.&lt;br&gt;Where did you find this question? Which IELTS Cambridge book did you find it in?&lt;br&gt;Pardon, the section’s name is ” IELTS CHARTS FOR PRACTICE”.&lt;br&gt;I know the one. You use past tense for “before” and present tense of “after”.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much, Liz. Thank you for your valuable time.&lt;br&gt;Thanks Liz 😍💜&lt;br&gt;Its clear now Liz . Thankyou so much for quick response and help.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz !&lt;br&gt;I wanna ask how is this task 1 estimated at band score 9 as it has 200+ words. I read in one of your reply that band score 9 has words between 170 and 190.&lt;br&gt;Can you please elaborate?&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;Don’t confuse advice with rules. There is no upper limit for words. However, you should aim for between 160 and 190 words (more or less). Writing more might lead you to add more detail and also increase your chances of making more language errors. You don’t get a particular band score because you have written a particular number of words. As I am fully trained and also a native English speaker, I can get away with reaching slightly over 200, but even so, most of my model answers fall just under 190 words.&lt;br&gt;Liz thank you so much 😊&lt;br&gt;Thanks you so much Liz mam ❤️❤️&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz&lt;br&gt;
I heard that there is a new rule of British Council that there should write a conclusion in Writing part 1? Is it true?&lt;br&gt;No. Writing task 1 is a report and you will see on the band score descriptors published by IELTS that the examiner is looking for an overview. Some people write a conclusion which is actually an overview – that is fine. It is about content and functionality. A conclusion traidtionally contains your opinions summarised – task 1 cannot contain opinions. A conclusion traditionally restates main points – task 1 cannot have repeated information. An overview is the one and only paragraph containing the key features of the task – it can be put after the introduction or at the end – some people put it at the end and call it an conclusion. That is the reason you are confused.&lt;br&gt;@Liz, which one is the best and good for achieving the IELTS band score.&lt;br&gt;
1.   Introduction &gt; Overview &gt; Paragraph 1 &gt; Paragraph 2.&lt;br&gt;
2.   Introduction with overview  &gt; Paragraph 1 &gt; PParagraph 2 &gt; Conclusion.&lt;br&gt;I am really so confused between above them. Please share your opinion.&lt;br&gt;See this page to learn: &lt;br&gt;. Use everything I have written to train yourself. That is the purpose of this site 🙂 The answer is there for you to find 🙂&lt;br&gt;Is it a must to write a conclusion in Task 1? Many people say, that you lose marks if there is no conclusion paragraph&lt;br&gt;You are immediately penalised if you do not write a conclusion in task 2. You are also immediately penalised if you do not write an overview in task 1.&lt;br&gt;I  have  heard that there should be no conclusion or overview in diagrams  of writing task 1&lt;br&gt;That is completely untrue. ALL writing task 1, for the academic paper, MUST have an Overview.&lt;br&gt;Liz is considered by me to be perfect teacher for all type of information regarding ielts.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for giving ur precious time to us.🙏🙏&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,I just wanna know if it is a band 9 sample ?!&lt;br&gt;And as i realize from this sample , each paragraph explains about only the related map.I want to know whether we need to compare all the three maps with each other or not.&lt;br&gt;In writing task 1, you compare when necessary – it is not necessary to compare all things at all times. You task is to write a report which is about reporting features – comparison often only comes in the overview. For a diagram, it sometimes doesn’t come at all. For some bar charts (not all) it is the main feature of the report. Each task type is different.&lt;br&gt;Hello Mam…some IELTS coaching institutes say that we should write overall in task 1 academci at last instead of after introduction because it also also like a conclusion and we write conclusion always at last…is it okay with this?&lt;br&gt;There are no fixed rules about this in IELTS. You can choose the position of the overview. However, remember that this is not an essay – it is a report.&lt;br&gt;This task contain much more words than 150&lt;br&gt;
…i think we are suppose to write upto      Maximum 180 word…&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;Your task is to write over 150 words. A high band score task 1 will usually have between 170 and 190 words. On the whole, it is best to avoid 200 words plus in order to reduce the density of errors and show the ability to select information.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz&lt;br&gt;
can we write “Meadowside village has been increased in size” But you have written “Meadowside village increased i size”  we can still see that the village has increased.But why didn’t you write it in present perfect passive.Please clarify&lt;br&gt;Meadowside village increased in size” is correct. You would not choose a passive voice for that statement.&lt;br&gt;I just watched your Map video Liz, in that you told that we should use the key ( Housing area), (town center) to change into small letters but in this model band 9 sample response it isn’t changed into small letters (meadows and fonton). Pls kindly clarify my doubt.   Thanks to YOU&lt;br&gt;You need to listen much more carefully to my video lessons. I did not say you remove ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. I said you must adapt the headings or labels to make them grammatically correct when you write them in a sentence. The word “Tennis” is usually given with a capital letter in a bar chart, but we do not use a capital letter with that word in an English sentence. The word “Food” might have a capital letter in a graph, but we don’t use it with a capital letter in an English sentence. You need to look at your map or chart and decide which headings must have the capital letter changed to make it grammatically correct in a sentence. Do you understand now?&lt;br&gt;Hotel has been constructed or hotel has constructed . What is duffernce between both sentences. Is it same meaning? Plz help me 🙏&lt;br&gt;The first is passive voice. You need to learn when to use it and when to use active voice.&lt;br&gt;The difference is bellow:&lt;br&gt;
someone has constructed the hotel&lt;br&gt;
the hotel has been constructed by someone&lt;br&gt;Writing task 1 I do not feel like writing properl.So learn me&lt;br&gt;This website is for people learning IELTS skills for a high score. It is not for people struggling with English. If your English level is not strong, you will need to improve your English before you think about IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Hlw,  in this task there are more than 4 paragraphs but in your video you told that there will be 4  paragraphs .. is it fine to write more paragraphs?? I am so confused now&lt;br&gt;The most common is 4. There is no fixed rule about the number of paragraphs for IELTS writing – only advice. It also depends on the task you are given and the information in the map or graph.",https://ieltsliz.com/ielts-map-model-answer/
