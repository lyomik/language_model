Nora,"Dear Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. My friend sent me the link to your blog when I was desperate. As soon as I realized I had figured it out, I turned into a huge ‚ÄúI GOT IT!‚Äù.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much. Your explanation is clear, simple, and to the point.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm so pleased for you. Those moments of ‚ÄúI got it!‚Äù are so important. I want everyone to realise that you can tackle IELTS, but you need to avoid over-thinking. IELTS is, in some ways, quite a logical test. But in the beginning it seems confusing and then there is bad advice online. Anyway, I‚Äôm pleased for you. I hope you continue to use all pages on my free website and eventually achieve the score you want. I‚Äôll keep my fingers crossed for you üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount of money that is spent on different consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume, cameras) in France and the UK in the year 2010. Units measured for the money is pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the most money that is spent by France and the UK are on cars and least is on cameras and perfumes respectively. We can say that that UK has spent more money in consumer goods than France. The expenditure on the cameras has significant difference in France and in the UK.&lt;br&gt;The cars, computers and the cameras were most spent on, in the UK around 450000-pound sterling, similarly France also spent most of their money on cars and computers but unlike UK it didn‚Äôt spend on cameras but on books, which is around 300,000-to-400,000-pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Coming to the least amount of expenditure on the goods, France spent it‚Äôs least amount of money on cameras and UK spent it‚Äôs least on perfumes. Cameras were one of the highest expenditures of UK in the year 2010 but were the least for France. Their difference significantly amounts to approximately 150,000 pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount of pounds sterling which were spent by Fance and U.K for goods such as cars, computers, books ,perfume and cameras in 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, France spend more money on computers and perfume, meanwhile U.K were much interested in cars, books, and cameras.&lt;br&gt;The expenditure rate of France for cars and computers was close about 400,000 pound sterling, with 25,000 difference. Meanwhile, for perfume and cameras France spent half as much as that for cars around 200,000 and 50,000 less for cameras.&lt;br&gt;The U.K hold a record for highest expenditure in the chart for cars which is around 450,000, also they spent for books as much as France for cars. In addition, computers and cameras rate of expenditure was the same 350,000 pound sterling. While the least amount was spent on perfume about 140,000 pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I was most scared of writing task and i scored 7.5 and 8 overall.&lt;br&gt;
You articles and topics helped me a lot in achieving this score.&lt;br&gt;Great results! Very well done to you! Thanks for coming back to share your results üôÇ&lt;br&gt;I have no idea how to check my writings. Are there any problems with my writing:&lt;br&gt;
The bar chart illustrates the spending of France and UK on five different goods in 2010. &lt;br&gt;Overall, in both countries the highest expenditure was on cars, while perfumes accounted for the lowest in the UK and the cameras had the lowest figure for France. Moreover, while the UK expenditure on cars, books and cameras was more than France, French spent more on computers and perfumes. &lt;br&gt;Expenditure on cars stands at 450,000 for the UK, and this figure, standing at 400,000, is slightly smaller for France. Likewise, while the British spent 400,000 pounds on books, French spent only 300,000 on this category. In terms of cameras, the figures show that spending of UK with just over 350,000 was more than double the rate for France with 150,000 pounds. &lt;br&gt;In contrast, French spent more on computers and perfumes. Expenditure of computers stands at approximately 380,000 for French, which is slightly more than the amount spent by British standing at 350.000. Likewise, expenses of perfume for France was 200,000 pounds, while it was less than 150,000 for the UK.&lt;br&gt;I don‚Äôt usually give feedback, but I will say it‚Äôs a strong piece of writing with the right structure and techniques. However, do make sure to list the categories in the introduction ‚Äì it‚Äôs important to introduce them before you refer to them. Of course, if the list if very long, you might not. But this list is short, so it is a good idea to introduce them. Also check your linking words ‚Äì you have a tendency to repeat them which will lower your score. Linking words are very easy to learn and it isn‚Äôt difficult to be flexible with them if you pay attention while you are writing. For example, you can use ‚Äúsimilarly‚Äù, ‚Äúalthough‚Äù, ‚Äúwhereas‚Äù, ‚Äúas opposed to‚Äù, ‚Äúin comparison to‚Äù etc. Lastly, pay attention to your tenses ‚Äúexpenditure on cars stands at‚Äù = ‚Äústood at‚Äù ‚Äì this is in 2010 so you need past tense. You also need to review the accuracy of your grammar as a whole.&lt;br&gt;Thanks a million, it was very helpful and I never thought I would get a feedback from you. I‚Äôm sending you all my best wishes for a swift recovery. I truly hope your illness fades away so you can be back to your healthy self soon.&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;Thanks a million. Well noted.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the spending on 5 consumer goods, namely cars, computers, books, perfumes and cameras, of France and the U.K. in the year 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the expenditure of the British was higher than that of the French. Both Britain and France spent the most money on cards. The British spent the least money on perfume compared to the French whose expenditure on cameras was the least.&lt;br&gt;Regarding the expenditure on cards, the British spent slightly more than ¬£450,000 while the French spent exactly ¬£400,000 on this. The U.K. spent over ¬£400,000 on books as opposed to ¬£300,000 spent by France. The amount of money spend on cameras by the U.K. was more than twice as the amount spent by France, which was over ¬£350,000 and ¬£150,000 respectively.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the French spent marginally more than ¬£350,000 on computers than the British did (¬£350,000). For the amount of money spent on perfumes, ¬£200,000 was spent by the French which was more than the British who spent less than ¬£150,000.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the consumer goods preferences of two countries (France and the UK) in 2010.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, cars and computers were the most consumed goods in both countries, with perfume being the least preferred. However, the UK had the highest expenditure on all goods when compared to France.&lt;br&gt;
The UK has spent more money on cars, books, and computers, respectively, when compared with France, which has fewer expenditures. Furthermore, the UK used more cars than France, and the difference is nearly 50,000 pounds sterling. In addition, the UK spent a significantly higher portion than France, and the difference was worth nearly a hundred thousand pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, the UK spent more on cameras, which are worth more than 350,000 pounds sterling, but France spent less on them, which cost 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;
In contrast, expenditure on computers was the only thing France spent over the UK; it was closer to 400,000 pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the money spend on the consumer goods (cars, computers , books, perfume and  cameras ) in UK and France in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it is clear that UK and France both spend most on cars while least on perfume in UK and cameras in France. The major difference was found on cameras .&lt;br&gt;
UK spend 450, 000 pounds on cars which is higher than France (400,000). UK spend more than France on books which is 400,000 pounds. (1000 pounds more than France). Likewise UK spend half 350,000 on cameras while France spend half less than UK on cameras (15,000).&lt;br&gt;
France spend more than UK on 2 items ( computer and perfume). France spend more than 350,000 on computers while UK spend exactly 350, 000 on computers. Similarly, France spend 200,000 pounds on perfume which is higher than UK‚Äôs expenditure i.e about 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume, cameras) in France and UK in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the UK spent more money on consumer goods than France in the year 2010. Both the British and French spent most of their money on cars where as the least amount of money was spent on perfume in UK compared to cameras in France. Furthermore, the most significant difference between both the countries in expenditure was on cameras.&lt;br&gt;In terms of cars, people in UK spent about 450,000 pounds sterlings as opposed to the French at 400000 pounds. Similarly British expenditure was more than double on cameras as compared to France (around 350,000 and 150,000 respectively). Whereas in France expenditure on perfumes (about 200000) was more than that of UK, which was under 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the amount of money spent on computers was more in France ( around 370,000 pounds) than that in UK, which was 350,000 pounds. There was a huge difference in expenditure on books between both the countries, which was around 400,000 pounds in UK and 300,000 in France.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart demonstrates the average spending on five types of consumer goods  in France  and the UK in 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, except for computers and perfume, the amount of money used for buying consumer goods in the UK was higher than that of France. Among the five categories, the expenditure on cars was always the highest in both countries.&lt;br&gt;Looking at the data of France, while the French spent 400,000 pounds on cars, this figure for perfume was 50% lower, at merely 200,000 pounds. As compared to cars, the expenditures for computers and books were slightly lower, with respective figures being 380,000 and 300,000 pounds. Besides, only 150,000 pounds were spent on camera, being the lowest consumer spending among the five kinds of goods.&lt;br&gt;Turning to the UK‚Äô statistic, it can be seen that the amount of money used for paid out on cars was over 450,000 pounds, and a third of it was the figure for perfume. Another noticeable feature is that the UK residents spent an equal amount of money on computers and cameras, which was approximately 350,000 pounds each.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôll leave similar feedback to a previous comment. Bar charts present categories as two bars so that those two bars can be compared together side by side. The two bars are France and the UK. This means you don‚Äôt separate the countries, you compare them.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much, I‚Äôve noted&lt;br&gt;greetings Liz,a question ;Is a symbol counted as a word&lt;br&gt;The symbol forms part of a number. For example, ‚Äú75%‚Äù is counted as one number in the writing test.&lt;br&gt;Wonderful explanation! Thank you liz.I love you from my heart for your amazing teaching method.&lt;br&gt;Glad you enjoy my lessons üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the national spending on five consumer commodities(cars,computers,books,perfumes and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010. Unit is in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the UK and france spent the most on cars. In France, the least expenditure was on cameras, while in the UK it was on perfumes. In total, the outlay of the UK was more than France.&lt;br&gt;
The information given indicates that the national spending on conusmer goods in france declined across all the categories with more expenses on cars(450,000 pounds). This amount was more than double the payments on cameras(180,000 pounds) which had  the lowest outlay for France.&lt;br&gt;
In contrast, the national expenditure of the UK fluctuated during this period,with most of it(400,000 pounds) alloted to  cars this was similar to France allotment on books for the period.The least payment for the UK was on perfumes(), with a slight difference in pay outs on computer by both countries respectively(350,000, 370,000) pounds.&lt;br&gt;please liz kindly rate my writing thanks for the efforts you have put into this  blog, am from Nigeria and am using your blog to study for my IELTS exam coming up in 2weeks.&lt;br&gt;The sentences ‚ÄúUnits are measured in ‚Ä¶‚Äù is always plural. The information about consumer spending in France declining over all categories, is an overview and belongs in the overview. When you describe a trend over the whole period without specific amounts put that information in the overview.&lt;br&gt;
A bar chart is about comparing the countries within the category ‚Äì exactly as shown in the chart. You describe, for example, cars and compare the spending of France and the UK in that category. You must respect the function of the bar chart and how the information is present in the chart.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, don‚Äôt use brackets all the time for the numbers. Your aim is to show how flexible you are with your sentence structures.&lt;br&gt;I have noted all the corrections you have said.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart compares the amount of money spent on the five various goods ( cars, computers, books, cameras) in 2010 in two Europeian countries (France and UK)&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it can be easily seen that UK has spent more money on cars, books and cameras. Also, The considerable difference between 2 countries was on cameras.&lt;br&gt;
To begin with chorus, UK has spent about 50000¬£ more than France showing 450000¬£. Above 350000¬£ was spent on computers in France. Similarly with cars, aproximately 400000¬£ has been spent on computer by UK in 2010&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand British expenditure was higher than France ( about 400000¬£ and 300000¬£ respectively). In both countries the amount of money spent on perfume was low which accounted 200000¬£ in France and just under 150000¬£ in UK. Camerad was one of the most popular item in Britian reaching just above 350000¬£ while France has the lowest point 150000¬£ in 2010&lt;br&gt;The chart below depicts the information about the spending on household items in United Kingdom and France in 2010.&lt;br&gt;
After analyzing the graph, it can be seen clearly that France spent 400,000 pound on cars in 2011 being greater than UK in same year. Total expenditure on computers in France was 375000 in given year. The money spent by France on remaining three goods (books, perfumes and cameras) was less than the first two items, which were 300,000,200,000 and 150,000 respectively.&lt;br&gt;
The graph further collate that the expenditure of UK on cars was around 460,000 pounds in 2011. However, UK spending on computers was less than France by about 350,000. After cars, books were the most consumed items in UK with around 410,000 pounds. Perfume was least consumed item by people of UK by approximately 140,000 pounds. UK spent almost double on cameras than France by about 360,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, France showed a downward trend and UK had some fluctuations in his expenditure on consumers goods.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Isn‚Äôt this answer a little above 200 words? Is it fine to write so much?&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;There is no word limit for any writing task in IELTS. However, longer answers might be less focused, contain more irrelevant information and could contain a greater density of language errors. I recommend all candidates to aim for between 170 and 190 words. However, I also like to show flexibility of options for people with higher level English and excellent IELTS exam skills&lt;br&gt;In many nations only a small group of individuals receive very high salaries. Few people debate that this is beneficial for the country and other‚Äôs think that government should put limits on salary.&lt;br&gt;Firstly, huge salaries are received by people with exceptional talent and the person who is doing that job may play a crucial role in the company‚Äôs or nations development, for instance in my country highest salaries are received by company ceo‚Äôs, and other government individuals like scientist, Ias officers etc. In my opinion it is justified giving them huge salaries because to get that position they must have worked very hard.By giving higer salaries one nation can potrait it‚Äôs economical strength and preserve its own talent, for example most of the students from russia with huge talent mostly tend to work in there country.&lt;br&gt; However, others believe that government should implement certain rules to limit the salaries received by a individual person. Mostly people believe that giving such a huge amount pf salaries to a single person can effect overall companies or government expenditure, also they think that poor and middle class families remain same. This also effects in pandemic time, for example in the USA due to inflation most of the common people became homeless, and the one who received higher salaries were able sustain that. There is always a difference between high salary employe and low salaried, due this per capita income is varied.&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, every individual has their own opinion, but according to me  putting restrictions on salaries can effect the overall development and If government implements certain rules then most of them will migrate to other countries for better life, instead government should bring more employment opportunities to improve overall employment rate and GDP.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, &lt;br&gt;Thank you for your lessons and materials. I noticed on the website that you advise sticking to the official British Council information for the test. I have a question related to this. In the official ‚ÄòRoad to IELTS‚Äô advice and tutorials for Writing Task 1 (IELTS Academic), the instructors suggest structuring the text as follows:&lt;br&gt;‚Äì Introduction&lt;br&gt;
‚Äì Body paragraphs&lt;br&gt;
‚Äì Overview (as a sort of concluding paragraph)&lt;br&gt;From your videos, you seem to suggest placing the ‚ÄòOverview‚Äô paragraph right after the ‚ÄòIntroduction,‚Äô which makes sense, and I agree with you on that. What is your opinion on this matter? Is the placement of the ‚ÄòOverview‚Äô paragraph interchangeable (meaning we won‚Äôt lose marks if it is positioned at the beginning of the text)?&lt;br&gt;Yes, it‚Äôs interchangeable. I have a video about this. Some people choose to put it at the end as a kind of conclusion. But the function of a conclusion is to restate main points. An overview doesn‚Äôt have this function. The overview actually states the main features for the first and only time, which is why putting it after the introduction is best. Secondly, when you put it at the end, people have a tendency to not pay much attention to its contents. What a mistake! It‚Äôs the most important paragraph in the whole of task 1. However, it‚Äôs position can be put in either place without impacting your marks. But always be aware of not prioritising it or repeating information if you choose to put it at the end.&lt;br&gt;Liz, in terms of numbers, is it a big deal to write 40.000 (forty thousand, as an example) with the point rather than with a comma? (Eg: 40,000)&lt;br&gt;What is the norm in English here? (Or otherwise, Maths‚Ä¶)&lt;br&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;br&gt;In English, the dot is used as a decimal point which would make 40.000 an actual number of just 40. We use commas to divide zeros for big numbers.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Units were measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Would it be wrong if I use past tense in this sentence??&lt;br&gt;
Thank You&lt;br&gt;We use the present tense for this statement because it refers to the graph currently in front of you.&lt;br&gt;The bar charts compare the amount of money spent on different groups of goods (cars, computers, books, perfume and cameras) in 2010 in France and the UK. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be clearly seen that the British in general spent more money than the French. The biggest expenditure for both countries was on cars, whereas the lowest for the UK was perfume and for France cameras.&lt;br&gt;In terms of the outlay of the UK, most of the money was paid for cars and books (just over 45,000 and 400,00 respectively). The expenditure on cameras and computers was almost equal at nearly 350,000, whereas the lowest amount of money was spent on perfume (under 150,000), which was at least 2 times less than on other goods.   &lt;br&gt;Moving on to the situation in France, they spent the majority of money on cars as in the UK, however their expenditure was by 50,000 less. In contrast, the French paid slightly more than the British for computers, which was followed by the outlay for books (nearly 380,000 and 300,000 respectively). Finally, perfume was ranked fourth at 200,000, followed by the least group in terms of expenditure, cameras, at 150,000, which was twice as less as the British paid for them.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount spent on five consumer goods (Cars, Computers, Books, Perfume, Cameras) in France and UK in the year 2010. Units are given in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, UK and France both spent most of their money in Cars. However, the least amount of money spent by UK was on Perfume whereas in case of France was Cameras. Furthermore, the most significant difference in expenditure between France and UK was Cameras.&lt;br&gt;Looking specifically at France, the figure shows it spent 400,000 pounds in Cars. Similarly, the expenditure of France on Perfume and Computers were 200,000 pound and about 375,000 pounds respectively which exceeded the expenditure spent by UK on both the goods. Moreover, The amount spent by France on Books was 300,000 which was double the expenditure on Cameras.&lt;br&gt;Regarding UK, Cars were the goods which UK spent most, with 450,000 pounds. The amount of 350,000 was paid out on Computers which was slightly less than the amount France invested. UK spent slightly little more than 400000 pounds on Books. Similarly, the expenditure of Cameras was slightly more than 350,000 pounds. However, the least expenditure spent was on the Perfume which was almost 150,000.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart provides data about money spent by the UK and France on consumption goods in the year of 2010. Unit of money is pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, both France and the UK spent most on cars.The UK‚Äôs expenditure on cameras was roughly twice as large as France‚Äôs.&lt;br&gt;Looking specifically at France, the amount of money spent on cars accounted for 400000, which was the highest in France.After cars, comes computers to a close second at around 380000.On the contrary, the least amount of funds was disbursed on cameras at exactly 150000, which is twice as little as the UK‚Äôs expenditure on cameras.&lt;br&gt;With respect to the UK,  it, like Fance, also had cars as the consumption goods on which the highest amount of funds was expended, which accounted for about 460000.Books was the second consumer item after cars on which the largest expenditure was made at around 410000.In contrast, the UK expended less than 150000 on perfume, which was the item on which the least expenditure made.&lt;br&gt;
Is the essay good enough?What band would it score?&lt;br&gt;The provided chart portrays the comparison between the amount of money spent by France and the UK, in 2010, on five consumer goods i.e. Cars, Computers, Books, Perfumes, and Cameras. The unit of measurement used to present the values is pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Most significantly, the total expenditure of the UK surpasses that of a France. The maximum amount of money spent by both the countries was on cars which amount to just above 450,000 and 400,000, respectively. Whereas, the minimum spending by the UK was on perfumes (Slightly less than 150,000) and by France it was on cameras (150,000).&lt;br&gt;
Getting into further depth, the items on which the spending by the UK was more than France were Cars, Books, and Cameras. On Cars, the UK spent 450,000 while France spent 400,000. Apart from that, the spending by the UK on Books and Cameras was just above then 400,000 and slightly above than 350,000, respectively, whereas, the spending by France on same items was 300,000 and 150,000, respectively. Collectively, the total spending by the UK on these three items was over 120,000 which was greater than France‚Äôs total 800,000.&lt;br&gt;
On the contrary, France (total over 550,000) exceeded the UK (total under 500,000) in terms of the spending on Computers and Perfumes. The amount of money spent by France on computers was above 350,000 as compared to 350,000 by the UK. Likewise, on Perfumes, France spent 200,000 while the UK spent less than 150,000.&lt;br&gt;P.s. I was unable to find pound sign on my keyboard so please consider it.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, &lt;br&gt;I find your blog super useful, thank you for taking the time to put all the elements needed to succeed on this exam. I‚Äôve been studied IELTS for almost two years now and have taken 3 exams so far; however, my writing score don‚Äôt seem to improve. After watching your video I had a bit of idea as of why this keep happening‚Ä¶ &lt;br&gt;The ‚Äútechniques‚Äù I‚Äôve been taught are very different from yours. I was told not to include any details on the introduction if I do I will lose points for that, as that must be part of the body. Also, the number of bodies will depend on the number of graph, meaning if I there is only one Bar chart I have to write only one body, if I write more I will lose marks. Of course summarising all details in one body will look messy. Basically, my writings look pretty much like this:&lt;br&gt;Introduction: The expenditure in France and the UK during 2010 is being depicted by the bar chart. &lt;br&gt;Body 1: As clearly seen, the x-axis contains the goods namely computers, perfumes, books among others, while the y-axis the amount spent in pounds. Then, I name the highest, lowest and order. &lt;br&gt;Conclusion‚Ä¶..&lt;br&gt;I honestly don‚Äôt know if this is one of the reasons I haven‚Äôt been able to get the score I need. I would appreciate your feedback, of course if you can give one.&lt;br&gt;Anyways, I have my test again in two weeks really hoping to get the score I need by following your recommendations. &lt;br&gt;Thank you so much again. üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Your introduction should help the reader know what the bar chart is about. If it is about the expenditure on goods, then introduce how many goods or name them. This information helps the reader understand the body paragraphs better. The name of each category is not a key feature, it is a factual element of the chart which the reader needs to know. So, always introduce names, categories, dates and another fact given about the chart.&lt;br&gt;
Body paragraphs can be used to divide categories into logical groups to help the reader understand the content and key features better.&lt;br&gt;
The overview is the most important paragraph. It does not repeat main points like a conclusion in task 2, it presents key features in a summary for the first and only time.&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt;
this page will help you with task 2: &lt;br&gt;
And my store contains advanced lessons and e-books for writing task 2: &lt;br&gt;Is it a good or bad idea to write something derived from what‚Äôs given on the chart? For example when mentioning the French expenditure on perfumes if I write&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúFrance‚Äôs 200,000 pounds expense on perfume was also higher than the UK which stood at around 100,000 pounds in the same category. Well, The French do have more admiration for scents.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;I love your ideas. Unfortunately, the answer is a big NO. Writing task 1 is a factual report based on what information is given, not on your perceptions, your opinion or your knowledge. No information can be added that isn‚Äôt given in the task.&lt;br&gt;Hello mam,&lt;br&gt;

This large production was also evident to other energy sources as gas, petro and nuclear. Whereas, there was only least production came from other source.&lt;br&gt;Generally, the significant source of energy came from coal with 29.80% in 1995 and over a third after ten years.

Conversely, production from petro drastically dropped from 29.27% in 1995 to around 10% less in 2005.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, energy came nuclear and other source both dramatically rose in 2005. 6.40% comprised of nuclear in 1995, and 4% more ten years later.

I really find interest in your video classes. All classes are full of meaning lessons. Not only that, every minutes of your classes is important. Thanks a lot for your efforts to us. We are really grateful to you.&lt;br&gt;
Love&lt;br&gt;
Saiful Sarker&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your message. I love to hear from a fellow teacher. I‚Äôm glad you find my lessons useful üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz! I prefer listening to your videos because you deliver each lesson very clearly. Your tips helped me a lot. I will be having my IELTS soon, it will be computer-delivered and I would like to know if there would be an automatic word count on where we will be doing our writing task?&lt;br&gt;Most people report having a word count option on the computer based test. However, don‚Äôt rely on it being there. There may be variations based on country or test centre. Good luck in your test üôÇ&lt;br&gt;In which tense we should write if not any dates are given in any charts. mainly in bar charts.&lt;br&gt;If there are no dates and the description doesn‚Äôt refer to the past or future, then you should use the present.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I just want to know that overview should be written in last or after introduction?&lt;br&gt;Both places are fine.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
The challenge in writing task 1 is the time allocated to write about the graph and figures. Within only 20 minutes, you are supposed to analyze the information, identify the key features, think of how to paraphrase the topic for the introduction and create different ways of comparing the data in the graph, not to mention being at pain to invent some cohesive devices for your writing. Do you think an English native speaker can do this with ease? Thanks a lot&lt;br&gt;Yes, if you train to do it. Each particular type of task 1 has its own approach and its own way of presenting data. All you need to do is learn the techniques for each type.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm grateful for all that you shareü§ó&lt;br&gt;Exactly my point but I think with constant practice, it wont be an issue.May God help us all,Amen.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, Can I use present tense always while writing in task 1 even though it talks about the past years in the graph?&lt;br&gt;Grammar is 25% of your marks and that includes using the right tense. If it is in the past, you should use past tense.&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount spent by France and the UK on consumer goods for the year 2010. The units are measured in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, both France and the UK spent maximum amount on the cars, while the minimum amount was spent on perfume by the UK, whereas, France spent minimum on cameras.&lt;br&gt;
From the observation, the expenditure of the UK was higher for cars, books and cameras as compared to France. The UK spent around 450,000 pounds on cars, whereas, 400,000 pounds was spent by France. The difference of 100,000 pounds was seen on the expenditure of books where the British spent just above 400,000 pounds. The UK spent around 350,000 pounds on cameras which is the double the amount as the French spent.&lt;br&gt;
On contrary, France paid higher the amount on computers and perfume as compared to the UK. The amount spent by French was below 400,000 pounds while the UK spent 350,000 pounds on computers. Just below 150,000 pounds was paid on perfume by the British, whereas, France expenditure was 200,00 pounds.&lt;br&gt;‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much for your help&lt;br&gt;Will I be penalized for crossing the word limit on any of the writing tasks?&lt;br&gt;Your aim is to go over the word limit. See this page: &lt;br&gt;What if, when it goes more than 250 words for writing task 1 to explain the big charts.&lt;br&gt;You will be marked down. Your task is to present key information and trends. You must not get lost in small detail.&lt;br&gt;Thank very much, Liz&lt;br&gt;
This is very useful chart for IELTS writing task 1, Liz explains a way that everyone understands. Thank for shown us the way, Liz.&lt;br&gt;Khadar&lt;br&gt;

British Somaliland&lt;br&gt;You‚Äôre welcome üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Hi liz. Good luck!&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Wishing you all the best.&lt;br&gt;
can I use the sequence ( Introduction , Body paragraph A, Body paragraph B, Overall), instead of ( Introduction, Overall , Body paragraph A, Body Paragraph B) ?&lt;br&gt;
Thanks&lt;br&gt;
Stay blessed , stay safe.&lt;br&gt;Sure. See this page to learn about writing task 1 including paragraphing: &lt;br&gt;The bar graph compares the money expenses of the UK and France on five different goods in the year 2010. Overall, it is readily apparent that the UK spent more on consumer goods than in France. Other features that stand out most are the highest amount of money spent on cars for both countries while the least significant is perfume in the UK  and cameras in France.&lt;br&gt;In regard to cars, the UK expenditure was over 450,000 pounds, being higher than France by 50,000 pounds. Also, the figures for books were almost identical, with 400,000 pounds of expenses in the UK while 300,000 pounds in France. Interestingly, the number of expenditures on cameras in the UK was over 350,000 pounds, which outraced the amount in France with only 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;However, when it comes to computers, the figure for France, which was around 375,000 pounds, exceed the UK with about 25,000 pounds. Similarly, while perfume was the least important in the UK with only 140,000 pounds of expenses, France was much higher by 60,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;hi liz&lt;br&gt;
in ielts do they only ask ques on chart or is there more types can u plz tell me the types of ques they can ask&lt;br&gt;Go to the HOME page and open the link to Writing Task 1 ‚Äì you will find everything you need to know.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz!&lt;br&gt;
 ƒ∞s it okay not to use symbols ,if we do not know exactly how to write it? for ex ‚Äúpound sterling‚Äù instead of symbol&lt;br&gt;
thanks&lt;3&lt;br&gt;There are certain symbols which we nearly always use instead of a word, such as ¬£, $ and %. It is fine to use them. The only time we use ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù is when we are texting so it isn‚Äôt suitable for formal writing.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Is it informal when we use the brackets in this task?&lt;br&gt;It is completely normal for some stats to be presented in brackets in an IELTS task 1 report.&lt;br&gt;Hello, Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Is there a pounds sterling symbol provided on the keyboard during CBT?&lt;br&gt;
This refers to all other special symbols as well. I found the pounds sterling symbol eventually by guess, but this takes time which is precious during the exam.&lt;br&gt;This is a very good question which you can ask you test centre about. It important that you ask as many questions to them about their equipment before the test day so that you feel confident and prepared to go in and do your best. If you get an answer from them, let me know what it is. It‚Äôs always useful to see how test centres respond.&lt;br&gt;How to use word infographic in writing task 1&lt;br&gt;It is not a word that is needed in IELTS Writing task 1. Not at all needed.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz&lt;br&gt;
I have a doubt regarding the logic behind separation of  body paragraphs that do I have to follow a set of rules for the division ,or I can come up with my own logic. If I have to follow a certain logic then can you please tell me where can I find those set of rules.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you&lt;br&gt;
Yatharth Mishra&lt;br&gt;You are being marked on logical organisation which also helps group key information together. The bar chart above is a chart of comparison, so you look for categories to compare which have similar key features. This is the logical way to organise this report. The organisation is also highlighted in the overview by stressing the key features which will inevitably be used to structure the paragraphs. There are no set rules ‚Äì you need to interpret the data, spot similarities and differences and organise accordingly. This is what you are being tested on as part of the marking criterion of Coherence and Cohesion which counts for 25% of your marks.&lt;br&gt;Hi Lizz! Can we leave space between every paragraph mean when we done with introduction so can we leave one line between each parargraph?&lt;br&gt;
Like introduction then one line space after that ‚Äúoverview‚Äù then one line space after that ‚Äù body paragraphs‚Äù.. Is it right way to write an essay??&lt;br&gt;This is the recommended way for both task 1 and task 2 writing. It helps make the paragraphs easy to see.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;I have a doubt in this paragraph, as you had said that we can‚Äôt use the same vocabulary more times but you have used ‚Äúexpenditure‚Äù 3 times is it correct?&lt;br&gt;can you please let me know how many times a vocab can be used in writing so that we don‚Äôt lose the marks.&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;
Love from India&lt;br&gt;Of course you can use words more than once. Some words will be repeated because they don‚Äôt have many options for paraphrasing. IELTS is not a trick test. Choose which words to paraphrasing and choosing how many paraphrases those words have. Not all words need to be changed.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
In the paragraph, you have written (was over double  that of France) is correct or it‚Äôs ( than of France)?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs correct. ‚Äúthat‚Äù refers to the amount.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much for your effort, your blog is really amazing. I have a question, you said in the listening section that either all the answers are written in capital letters or all of them are written in small letters, does that apply to the writing section as well ? I mean if I write my answers in capital letters in listening so even in writing section my answers have to be in capital ? Thanks in advance&lt;br&gt;For the writing test, you should write normally with grammatically correct use of capital letters. Your use of appropriate capital letters will be marked as part of the criterion for grammar.&lt;br&gt;Okay thank you so much&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much Liz for sharing all this for free. What are the differences, if any, between the writing of general and academic tests?&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;Please go to the RED MENU BAR and open the drop down options for Test Info. You will find a page for GT and Academic differences.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz&lt;br&gt;Thanks liz mam you are ossomm.  Your  ideas are extremely  helpful for ielts  students..&lt;br&gt;Can i use moreover ,however,buy ,yet ,in addition to .in tast 1&lt;br&gt;Yes, you can. You can see some of them used in my model answers on this page: &lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, first of all I wanted to thank you for your amazing help!&lt;br&gt;
I also wanted to ask if it is okay not to write a conclusion, which I‚Äôm used to doing both in English and in my mother tongue, if I write the overview first. Do you think I‚Äôd lose points if I write both an overview and at the end a conclusion? (not with the same words/ exact content)&lt;br&gt;Thank you in advanceüòô&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt; There‚Äôs a video about an overview/conclusion.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;Is it okay if I put some details in bullet points under one of the paragraph in writing task 1?&lt;br&gt;
For example‚Ä¶&lt;br&gt;
I request he hotel manager to provide the below mentioned details.&lt;br&gt;
  1. what kind of services your company offer?&lt;br&gt;
  2 . what kind of rooms available your hotel?&lt;br&gt;
  3‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;
  4‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;
  5‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;Is it okay to use such structure?&lt;br&gt;You are being marked on grammar. Sentence structures are 25% of your marks ‚Äì no notes, no bullet points. Just paragraphs and full sentences exactly the same as I have in my model answers.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Thanks again for your amazing website. My question is that is it okay to have an overview without any data given? For example here, it just shows the key features and the data are only included in the next body paragraphs.&lt;br&gt;Most overviews present key features rather than data. The only time I might include data in an overview is if the total is given with a table ‚Äì but that isn‚Äôt a rule, it‚Äôs just my way of tackling things.&lt;br&gt;/* Please  let me know my weakness so i can upgrade myself*/&lt;br&gt;The bar diagram manifests the information regarding spending of two countries (France and UK ) on top five accessories(cars, computers, books, perfumes and cameras) in 2010. Units are measured in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the trend of spending money in UK was higher than that of France. Also, cars were most popular items  in both of these countries as both of them spent lots of money on it. Incontrast, prefume was the less preferred product in UK where as it was camera in case of france.Furthermore, the  significant differences on expenditure between these two countries was on camera.&lt;br&gt;It can be seen that spending on  cars , books and cameras   were much more higher in UK comparing to France as they spend around $450000,  $400000  and $350000 respectivelly on it . However it was almost $400000, $ 300000  and $ 150000 accordingly in case of France.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, computers and perfumes were less preferred products in UK by contributing about $340000 and $150000 respectivelly  while people from france spent about $ 370000 and $200000 accordingly on it.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;I would like to know whether we can use merely instead of mere as shown in the above writing sample.&lt;br&gt;Is it correct to say&lt;br&gt;
: The energy produced by coal comprised of 29.80 % in the year 1995 and it showed a slight increase i.e. merely 1 percent in the year 2005.&lt;br&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;
Harpreet&lt;br&gt;‚Äúie‚Äù is when you are giving examples. There are no examples in writing task 1. There is actual data ‚Äì not examples of data. For this reason, your sentence is incorrect.&lt;br&gt;‚Äúie‚Äù refers to ‚Äòid est‚Äô in Latin, meaning ‚Äòthis is‚Äô or ‚Äòin other words‚Äô.&lt;br&gt;
‚Äúeg‚Äù refers to ‚Äòexempli gratia‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòfor example‚Äô.&lt;br&gt;
These are highly used in scientific writing, but I would avoid using them in IELTS as the examiner may get confused between the two.&lt;br&gt;The examiner would not get confused between the two at all. The reason you don‚Äôt use them is because you want to demonstrate your range of linking words ‚Äì such as, for example, to illustrate, namely etc ‚Äì this is about knowing the band scores, knowing marking criteria for IELTS and understanding how to maximise your score in the right way.&lt;br&gt;Honorable teacher,in paragraph 2 you used French and British,the name of the two nations  instead of their country‚Äôs name.In the question we can see ‚Äúthe expenditure of two countries‚Äù.The assertion does not mean that all those expenditure were made by the citizen of those countries.For example,in France some expenditure can be made by Spanish people.So why will we say them French expenditure?&lt;br&gt;Because it is standard language accepted in report writing. When we see figures for British exports ‚Äì it does not mean that all exports were by British citizens rather than the statistics come from the country.&lt;br&gt;Hii ma‚Äôam &lt;br&gt;Your way of teaching is quite fascinating, in other word so sweet.beside its seems that your all videos on youtube is so old so is there any mkst recent videos on writing or reading ??&lt;br&gt;The test has not changed. Those videos are 100% essential today.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz. Can we use ‚Äù (450.000 and 300.000 respectively)  ‚Äù to give details about money or numbers in real exam?&lt;br&gt;Any language used in my model answers is suitable for IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
 Your video are great and very useful. If possible can you give me an explanation on the usage of ‚Äúas opposed‚Äù and any other similar words which can boost my writing.&lt;br&gt;
I was fascinating, will it be good to add a conclusion part in the writing task?&lt;br&gt;
I have 4 days for  my exam. Can you please advise on how to plan my preparation?&lt;br&gt;Go to the writing task 1 section and writing task 2 section of this site for linking words and more. Use the RED MENU BAR.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for your tips, practice questions and model answers. It is beneficial.&lt;br&gt;
Also, while reading the model answer, I was confused about whether to use ‚Äúwas or were‚Äù in the last paragraph sentence ‚Äù spent by the French on computers was slightly more.‚Äù Does it hold the subject-verb agreement?&lt;br&gt;The word ‚Äúcomputers‚Äù is not the subject to the verb in that clause.&lt;br&gt;Thanks Liz&lt;br&gt;hello ma‚Äôam, I would love to know if the charts are also for the general test or just academics.&lt;br&gt;See this page and read the information carefully: &lt;br&gt;Is it okay to say ‚Äù Overall , the UK‚Äù to ‚Äù Overall , UK has spent‚Ä¶.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;‚Äúthe UK‚Äù is grammatically correct. ‚ÄúUK‚Äù without ‚Äúthe‚Äù is not correct. You need to learn which country names use ‚Äúthe‚Äù and which do not.&lt;br&gt;Then ‚Äúthe France‚Äù will be corrected or only France will be true?&lt;br&gt;‚ÄúFrance‚Äù does not have ‚Äúthe‚Äù in front of it. ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù does not have ‚Äúthe‚Äù in front of it. ‚ÄúThe UK‚Äù does. Please google this or check a grammar books.&lt;br&gt;I want to know if it is ok to write everything in Capital Letters in Computerized version of IELTS in Writing, Reading and Listening exam ?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs fine for listening and reading, but not recommended for writing. You need to show correct use of capital letters for the marking criterion of grammar in IELTS writing.&lt;br&gt;You are so cute mam. I think I m falling love with your assent . Thanks you for giving us such a knowledge about IELTS ‚Ä¶ I love you mam&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm glad you like my lessons üôÇ&lt;br&gt;I got the Cambridge guide to Ielts for my self study. In the writing section they have strictly mentioned that task 1 should have a maximum of 150 words and task 2 of 250 words. But here in your model answer the words are more than 200. I guess they have updated it. Just wanted you to know that.&lt;br&gt;And I even have a question. You said they count the currency symbol as a word so what about ),( and % ?.&lt;br&gt;You need to check the instructions again. The instructions are ‚Äúno less than 150 words‚Äù. 150 words for task 1 is a minimum ‚Äì not the maximum.&lt;br&gt;Hello mam,&lt;br&gt;
I think so word limit is exceeding&lt;br&gt;
Thankyou&lt;br&gt;Good organization of work. Have learnt something.&lt;br&gt;
But wanted to know the difference between pie and bar chart. Do the contents in the introduction and overview the same?&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt;Hello Miss less hope you are good&lt;br&gt;
 I have a doubt&lt;br&gt;
Can we use side topics or side headings such as introduction explanation for overview and finally for conclusion like this?&lt;br&gt;All task 1 reports and task 2 essays should be written exactly as shown in my model answers. If I don‚Äôt use headings, you don‚Äôt use headings.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;i‚Äôm not sure, if we can use the British and the French, since there are also foreigners live or travel and buy something as souvenirs there, like book and perfume. The chart only ilustrates the amount of money spent on consumer goods in two countries, without dividing the consumer. What do you think?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs fine to do this in IELTS.&lt;br&gt;But UK and Britain are not the same, Britain along with Northern Ireland is a part of UK  so you can not call the people of whole UK British.&lt;br&gt;
Does that effect the score though?&lt;br&gt;You are confusing ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù and ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù. The nationality of all people in the UK is British. They are all British citizens. However, people from England call themselves English and people from Scotland call themselves Scottish ‚Äì regardless ‚Äì they are still legally British citizens ‚Äì that is their formal nationality. If you are unsure of nationalities, please review them carefully for task 1.&lt;br&gt;i,m sorry maam but i think that money is countable while milk.water,oil,etc are uncountable. correct me if i,m wrong.thanks&lt;br&gt;That is not correct. We never have ‚Äúa money‚Äù. The word ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is uncountable.&lt;br&gt;Hi dear Lis&lt;br&gt;isnt it wrong using on the other hand without mentioning on one hand?&lt;br&gt;IT is completely fine to do that. It‚Äôs fine to use ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù without ‚Äúon the one hand‚Äù. But you can‚Äôt use ‚Äúon the one hand‚Äù without ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù.&lt;br&gt;Greeting, liz!&lt;br&gt;thank you for remarkable example for wrting task 1 but i have one question. If i followed this method exactly like what you did for the concept. Will i acquire a 9 score for sure?&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;Your score is based on Task Achievement (the key features you choose and how you group information), Coherence &amp; Cohesion, Vocabulary and Grammar. So, just following a structure is only one part of one criterion. You must show skills in all four areas and have excellent language skills to get band 9.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz, quick question. The last paragraph looks a bit long without any comma or full stop. It‚Äôs that OK?&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm not sure which paragraph you are referring to. The last paragraph is:&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the amount of money paid out on the remaining goods was higher in France. Above ¬£350,000 was spent by the French on computers which was slightly more than the British who spent exactly ¬£350,000. Neither of the countries spent much on perfume which accounted for ¬£200,000 of expenditure in France but under ¬£150,000 in the UK.&lt;br&gt;It has three sentences in it. Is this the paragraph you mean?&lt;br&gt;Greetings, Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Is it necessary to begin the overview with the word ‚Äòoverall‚Äô? Is there no other alternative?&lt;br&gt;regards&lt;br&gt;
Joy&lt;br&gt;IT is the best word to use that indicates an overview. Remember this is a factual report, not creative writing. You don‚Äôt get a higher score because you used a different word. You get a higher score because you avoid errors and use language appropriately.&lt;br&gt;hi liz, is it allowed to leave one empty line to start a new paragraph in writing tasks? thanks&lt;br&gt;IT is recommended to do that.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liza , I have a doubt that the prepositions will be count as a word or not . Please reply me struggling with this doubt!&lt;br&gt;All words are counted ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt matter how big or how small or if they are in brackets ‚Äì all words. (20 words).&lt;br&gt;So we should leave one empty line between paragraphs?&lt;br&gt;It is the best way to make the paragraphs easy for the examiner to read.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Mam. ,,,,,You are really a very good teacher. ,,,,,,, God bless you more and more,,,,,&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz&lt;br&gt;
I‚Äôm Hamid and I‚Äôm an English teacher.&lt;br&gt;
I really find your tips and videos very useful and perfect.&lt;br&gt;
love,&lt;br&gt;
Hamid&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I just wanted to thank you for your effort.&lt;br&gt;
I used your website for a week to study and I must say the content is very useful. I did the test today and I feel really good about it. I will get the results in 2 weeks.&lt;br&gt;Do share your result here when you got it. Thanks!",https://ieltsliz.com/ielts-model-bar-chart-band-score-9/
Nora,"Dear Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. My friend sent me the link to your blog when I was desperate. As soon as I realized I had figured it out, I turned into a huge ‚ÄúI GOT IT!‚Äù.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much. Your explanation is clear, simple, and to the point.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm so pleased for you. Those moments of ‚ÄúI got it!‚Äù are so important. I want everyone to realise that you can tackle IELTS, but you need to avoid over-thinking. IELTS is, in some ways, quite a logical test. But in the beginning it seems confusing and then there is bad advice online. Anyway, I‚Äôm pleased for you. I hope you continue to use all pages on my free website and eventually achieve the score you want. I‚Äôll keep my fingers crossed for you üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount of money that is spent on different consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume, cameras) in France and the UK in the year 2010. Units measured for the money is pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the most money that is spent by France and the UK are on cars and least is on cameras and perfumes respectively. We can say that that UK has spent more money in consumer goods than France. The expenditure on the cameras has significant difference in France and in the UK.&lt;br&gt;The cars, computers and the cameras were most spent on, in the UK around 450000-pound sterling, similarly France also spent most of their money on cars and computers but unlike UK it didn‚Äôt spend on cameras but on books, which is around 300,000-to-400,000-pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Coming to the least amount of expenditure on the goods, France spent it‚Äôs least amount of money on cameras and UK spent it‚Äôs least on perfumes. Cameras were one of the highest expenditures of UK in the year 2010 but were the least for France. Their difference significantly amounts to approximately 150,000 pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount of pounds sterling which were spent by Fance and U.K for goods such as cars, computers, books ,perfume and cameras in 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, France spend more money on computers and perfume, meanwhile U.K were much interested in cars, books, and cameras.&lt;br&gt;The expenditure rate of France for cars and computers was close about 400,000 pound sterling, with 25,000 difference. Meanwhile, for perfume and cameras France spent half as much as that for cars around 200,000 and 50,000 less for cameras.&lt;br&gt;The U.K hold a record for highest expenditure in the chart for cars which is around 450,000, also they spent for books as much as France for cars. In addition, computers and cameras rate of expenditure was the same 350,000 pound sterling. While the least amount was spent on perfume about 140,000 pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I was most scared of writing task and i scored 7.5 and 8 overall.&lt;br&gt;
You articles and topics helped me a lot in achieving this score.&lt;br&gt;Great results! Very well done to you! Thanks for coming back to share your results üôÇ&lt;br&gt;I have no idea how to check my writings. Are there any problems with my writing:&lt;br&gt;
The bar chart illustrates the spending of France and UK on five different goods in 2010. &lt;br&gt;Overall, in both countries the highest expenditure was on cars, while perfumes accounted for the lowest in the UK and the cameras had the lowest figure for France. Moreover, while the UK expenditure on cars, books and cameras was more than France, French spent more on computers and perfumes. &lt;br&gt;Expenditure on cars stands at 450,000 for the UK, and this figure, standing at 400,000, is slightly smaller for France. Likewise, while the British spent 400,000 pounds on books, French spent only 300,000 on this category. In terms of cameras, the figures show that spending of UK with just over 350,000 was more than double the rate for France with 150,000 pounds. &lt;br&gt;In contrast, French spent more on computers and perfumes. Expenditure of computers stands at approximately 380,000 for French, which is slightly more than the amount spent by British standing at 350.000. Likewise, expenses of perfume for France was 200,000 pounds, while it was less than 150,000 for the UK.&lt;br&gt;I don‚Äôt usually give feedback, but I will say it‚Äôs a strong piece of writing with the right structure and techniques. However, do make sure to list the categories in the introduction ‚Äì it‚Äôs important to introduce them before you refer to them. Of course, if the list if very long, you might not. But this list is short, so it is a good idea to introduce them. Also check your linking words ‚Äì you have a tendency to repeat them which will lower your score. Linking words are very easy to learn and it isn‚Äôt difficult to be flexible with them if you pay attention while you are writing. For example, you can use ‚Äúsimilarly‚Äù, ‚Äúalthough‚Äù, ‚Äúwhereas‚Äù, ‚Äúas opposed to‚Äù, ‚Äúin comparison to‚Äù etc. Lastly, pay attention to your tenses ‚Äúexpenditure on cars stands at‚Äù = ‚Äústood at‚Äù ‚Äì this is in 2010 so you need past tense. You also need to review the accuracy of your grammar as a whole.&lt;br&gt;Thanks a million, it was very helpful and I never thought I would get a feedback from you. I‚Äôm sending you all my best wishes for a swift recovery. I truly hope your illness fades away so you can be back to your healthy self soon.&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;Thanks a million. Well noted.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the spending on 5 consumer goods, namely cars, computers, books, perfumes and cameras, of France and the U.K. in the year 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the expenditure of the British was higher than that of the French. Both Britain and France spent the most money on cards. The British spent the least money on perfume compared to the French whose expenditure on cameras was the least.&lt;br&gt;Regarding the expenditure on cards, the British spent slightly more than ¬£450,000 while the French spent exactly ¬£400,000 on this. The U.K. spent over ¬£400,000 on books as opposed to ¬£300,000 spent by France. The amount of money spend on cameras by the U.K. was more than twice as the amount spent by France, which was over ¬£350,000 and ¬£150,000 respectively.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the French spent marginally more than ¬£350,000 on computers than the British did (¬£350,000). For the amount of money spent on perfumes, ¬£200,000 was spent by the French which was more than the British who spent less than ¬£150,000.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the consumer goods preferences of two countries (France and the UK) in 2010.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, cars and computers were the most consumed goods in both countries, with perfume being the least preferred. However, the UK had the highest expenditure on all goods when compared to France.&lt;br&gt;
The UK has spent more money on cars, books, and computers, respectively, when compared with France, which has fewer expenditures. Furthermore, the UK used more cars than France, and the difference is nearly 50,000 pounds sterling. In addition, the UK spent a significantly higher portion than France, and the difference was worth nearly a hundred thousand pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, the UK spent more on cameras, which are worth more than 350,000 pounds sterling, but France spent less on them, which cost 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;
In contrast, expenditure on computers was the only thing France spent over the UK; it was closer to 400,000 pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the money spend on the consumer goods (cars, computers , books, perfume and  cameras ) in UK and France in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it is clear that UK and France both spend most on cars while least on perfume in UK and cameras in France. The major difference was found on cameras .&lt;br&gt;
UK spend 450, 000 pounds on cars which is higher than France (400,000). UK spend more than France on books which is 400,000 pounds. (1000 pounds more than France). Likewise UK spend half 350,000 on cameras while France spend half less than UK on cameras (15,000).&lt;br&gt;
France spend more than UK on 2 items ( computer and perfume). France spend more than 350,000 on computers while UK spend exactly 350, 000 on computers. Similarly, France spend 200,000 pounds on perfume which is higher than UK‚Äôs expenditure i.e about 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume, cameras) in France and UK in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the UK spent more money on consumer goods than France in the year 2010. Both the British and French spent most of their money on cars where as the least amount of money was spent on perfume in UK compared to cameras in France. Furthermore, the most significant difference between both the countries in expenditure was on cameras.&lt;br&gt;In terms of cars, people in UK spent about 450,000 pounds sterlings as opposed to the French at 400000 pounds. Similarly British expenditure was more than double on cameras as compared to France (around 350,000 and 150,000 respectively). Whereas in France expenditure on perfumes (about 200000) was more than that of UK, which was under 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the amount of money spent on computers was more in France ( around 370,000 pounds) than that in UK, which was 350,000 pounds. There was a huge difference in expenditure on books between both the countries, which was around 400,000 pounds in UK and 300,000 in France.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart demonstrates the average spending on five types of consumer goods  in France  and the UK in 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, except for computers and perfume, the amount of money used for buying consumer goods in the UK was higher than that of France. Among the five categories, the expenditure on cars was always the highest in both countries.&lt;br&gt;Looking at the data of France, while the French spent 400,000 pounds on cars, this figure for perfume was 50% lower, at merely 200,000 pounds. As compared to cars, the expenditures for computers and books were slightly lower, with respective figures being 380,000 and 300,000 pounds. Besides, only 150,000 pounds were spent on camera, being the lowest consumer spending among the five kinds of goods.&lt;br&gt;Turning to the UK‚Äô statistic, it can be seen that the amount of money used for paid out on cars was over 450,000 pounds, and a third of it was the figure for perfume. Another noticeable feature is that the UK residents spent an equal amount of money on computers and cameras, which was approximately 350,000 pounds each.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôll leave similar feedback to a previous comment. Bar charts present categories as two bars so that those two bars can be compared together side by side. The two bars are France and the UK. This means you don‚Äôt separate the countries, you compare them.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much, I‚Äôve noted&lt;br&gt;greetings Liz,a question ;Is a symbol counted as a word&lt;br&gt;The symbol forms part of a number. For example, ‚Äú75%‚Äù is counted as one number in the writing test.&lt;br&gt;Wonderful explanation! Thank you liz.I love you from my heart for your amazing teaching method.&lt;br&gt;Glad you enjoy my lessons üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the national spending on five consumer commodities(cars,computers,books,perfumes and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010. Unit is in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the UK and france spent the most on cars. In France, the least expenditure was on cameras, while in the UK it was on perfumes. In total, the outlay of the UK was more than France.&lt;br&gt;
The information given indicates that the national spending on conusmer goods in france declined across all the categories with more expenses on cars(450,000 pounds). This amount was more than double the payments on cameras(180,000 pounds) which had  the lowest outlay for France.&lt;br&gt;
In contrast, the national expenditure of the UK fluctuated during this period,with most of it(400,000 pounds) alloted to  cars this was similar to France allotment on books for the period.The least payment for the UK was on perfumes(), with a slight difference in pay outs on computer by both countries respectively(350,000, 370,000) pounds.&lt;br&gt;please liz kindly rate my writing thanks for the efforts you have put into this  blog, am from Nigeria and am using your blog to study for my IELTS exam coming up in 2weeks.&lt;br&gt;The sentences ‚ÄúUnits are measured in ‚Ä¶‚Äù is always plural. The information about consumer spending in France declining over all categories, is an overview and belongs in the overview. When you describe a trend over the whole period without specific amounts put that information in the overview.&lt;br&gt;
A bar chart is about comparing the countries within the category ‚Äì exactly as shown in the chart. You describe, for example, cars and compare the spending of France and the UK in that category. You must respect the function of the bar chart and how the information is present in the chart.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, don‚Äôt use brackets all the time for the numbers. Your aim is to show how flexible you are with your sentence structures.&lt;br&gt;I have noted all the corrections you have said.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart compares the amount of money spent on the five various goods ( cars, computers, books, cameras) in 2010 in two Europeian countries (France and UK)&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it can be easily seen that UK has spent more money on cars, books and cameras. Also, The considerable difference between 2 countries was on cameras.&lt;br&gt;
To begin with chorus, UK has spent about 50000¬£ more than France showing 450000¬£. Above 350000¬£ was spent on computers in France. Similarly with cars, aproximately 400000¬£ has been spent on computer by UK in 2010&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand British expenditure was higher than France ( about 400000¬£ and 300000¬£ respectively). In both countries the amount of money spent on perfume was low which accounted 200000¬£ in France and just under 150000¬£ in UK. Camerad was one of the most popular item in Britian reaching just above 350000¬£ while France has the lowest point 150000¬£ in 2010&lt;br&gt;The chart below depicts the information about the spending on household items in United Kingdom and France in 2010.&lt;br&gt;
After analyzing the graph, it can be seen clearly that France spent 400,000 pound on cars in 2011 being greater than UK in same year. Total expenditure on computers in France was 375000 in given year. The money spent by France on remaining three goods (books, perfumes and cameras) was less than the first two items, which were 300,000,200,000 and 150,000 respectively.&lt;br&gt;
The graph further collate that the expenditure of UK on cars was around 460,000 pounds in 2011. However, UK spending on computers was less than France by about 350,000. After cars, books were the most consumed items in UK with around 410,000 pounds. Perfume was least consumed item by people of UK by approximately 140,000 pounds. UK spent almost double on cameras than France by about 360,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, France showed a downward trend and UK had some fluctuations in his expenditure on consumers goods.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Isn‚Äôt this answer a little above 200 words? Is it fine to write so much?&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;There is no word limit for any writing task in IELTS. However, longer answers might be less focused, contain more irrelevant information and could contain a greater density of language errors. I recommend all candidates to aim for between 170 and 190 words. However, I also like to show flexibility of options for people with higher level English and excellent IELTS exam skills&lt;br&gt;In many nations only a small group of individuals receive very high salaries. Few people debate that this is beneficial for the country and other‚Äôs think that government should put limits on salary.&lt;br&gt;Firstly, huge salaries are received by people with exceptional talent and the person who is doing that job may play a crucial role in the company‚Äôs or nations development, for instance in my country highest salaries are received by company ceo‚Äôs, and other government individuals like scientist, Ias officers etc. In my opinion it is justified giving them huge salaries because to get that position they must have worked very hard.By giving higer salaries one nation can potrait it‚Äôs economical strength and preserve its own talent, for example most of the students from russia with huge talent mostly tend to work in there country.&lt;br&gt; However, others believe that government should implement certain rules to limit the salaries received by a individual person. Mostly people believe that giving such a huge amount pf salaries to a single person can effect overall companies or government expenditure, also they think that poor and middle class families remain same. This also effects in pandemic time, for example in the USA due to inflation most of the common people became homeless, and the one who received higher salaries were able sustain that. There is always a difference between high salary employe and low salaried, due this per capita income is varied.&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, every individual has their own opinion, but according to me  putting restrictions on salaries can effect the overall development and If government implements certain rules then most of them will migrate to other countries for better life, instead government should bring more employment opportunities to improve overall employment rate and GDP.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, &lt;br&gt;Thank you for your lessons and materials. I noticed on the website that you advise sticking to the official British Council information for the test. I have a question related to this. In the official ‚ÄòRoad to IELTS‚Äô advice and tutorials for Writing Task 1 (IELTS Academic), the instructors suggest structuring the text as follows:&lt;br&gt;‚Äì Introduction&lt;br&gt;
‚Äì Body paragraphs&lt;br&gt;
‚Äì Overview (as a sort of concluding paragraph)&lt;br&gt;From your videos, you seem to suggest placing the ‚ÄòOverview‚Äô paragraph right after the ‚ÄòIntroduction,‚Äô which makes sense, and I agree with you on that. What is your opinion on this matter? Is the placement of the ‚ÄòOverview‚Äô paragraph interchangeable (meaning we won‚Äôt lose marks if it is positioned at the beginning of the text)?&lt;br&gt;Yes, it‚Äôs interchangeable. I have a video about this. Some people choose to put it at the end as a kind of conclusion. But the function of a conclusion is to restate main points. An overview doesn‚Äôt have this function. The overview actually states the main features for the first and only time, which is why putting it after the introduction is best. Secondly, when you put it at the end, people have a tendency to not pay much attention to its contents. What a mistake! It‚Äôs the most important paragraph in the whole of task 1. However, it‚Äôs position can be put in either place without impacting your marks. But always be aware of not prioritising it or repeating information if you choose to put it at the end.&lt;br&gt;Liz, in terms of numbers, is it a big deal to write 40.000 (forty thousand, as an example) with the point rather than with a comma? (Eg: 40,000)&lt;br&gt;What is the norm in English here? (Or otherwise, Maths‚Ä¶)&lt;br&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;br&gt;In English, the dot is used as a decimal point which would make 40.000 an actual number of just 40. We use commas to divide zeros for big numbers.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Units were measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Would it be wrong if I use past tense in this sentence??&lt;br&gt;
Thank You&lt;br&gt;We use the present tense for this statement because it refers to the graph currently in front of you.&lt;br&gt;The bar charts compare the amount of money spent on different groups of goods (cars, computers, books, perfume and cameras) in 2010 in France and the UK. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be clearly seen that the British in general spent more money than the French. The biggest expenditure for both countries was on cars, whereas the lowest for the UK was perfume and for France cameras.&lt;br&gt;In terms of the outlay of the UK, most of the money was paid for cars and books (just over 45,000 and 400,00 respectively). The expenditure on cameras and computers was almost equal at nearly 350,000, whereas the lowest amount of money was spent on perfume (under 150,000), which was at least 2 times less than on other goods.   &lt;br&gt;Moving on to the situation in France, they spent the majority of money on cars as in the UK, however their expenditure was by 50,000 less. In contrast, the French paid slightly more than the British for computers, which was followed by the outlay for books (nearly 380,000 and 300,000 respectively). Finally, perfume was ranked fourth at 200,000, followed by the least group in terms of expenditure, cameras, at 150,000, which was twice as less as the British paid for them.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount spent on five consumer goods (Cars, Computers, Books, Perfume, Cameras) in France and UK in the year 2010. Units are given in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, UK and France both spent most of their money in Cars. However, the least amount of money spent by UK was on Perfume whereas in case of France was Cameras. Furthermore, the most significant difference in expenditure between France and UK was Cameras.&lt;br&gt;Looking specifically at France, the figure shows it spent 400,000 pounds in Cars. Similarly, the expenditure of France on Perfume and Computers were 200,000 pound and about 375,000 pounds respectively which exceeded the expenditure spent by UK on both the goods. Moreover, The amount spent by France on Books was 300,000 which was double the expenditure on Cameras.&lt;br&gt;Regarding UK, Cars were the goods which UK spent most, with 450,000 pounds. The amount of 350,000 was paid out on Computers which was slightly less than the amount France invested. UK spent slightly little more than 400000 pounds on Books. Similarly, the expenditure of Cameras was slightly more than 350,000 pounds. However, the least expenditure spent was on the Perfume which was almost 150,000.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart provides data about money spent by the UK and France on consumption goods in the year of 2010. Unit of money is pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, both France and the UK spent most on cars.The UK‚Äôs expenditure on cameras was roughly twice as large as France‚Äôs.&lt;br&gt;Looking specifically at France, the amount of money spent on cars accounted for 400000, which was the highest in France.After cars, comes computers to a close second at around 380000.On the contrary, the least amount of funds was disbursed on cameras at exactly 150000, which is twice as little as the UK‚Äôs expenditure on cameras.&lt;br&gt;With respect to the UK,  it, like Fance, also had cars as the consumption goods on which the highest amount of funds was expended, which accounted for about 460000.Books was the second consumer item after cars on which the largest expenditure was made at around 410000.In contrast, the UK expended less than 150000 on perfume, which was the item on which the least expenditure made.&lt;br&gt;
Is the essay good enough?What band would it score?&lt;br&gt;The provided chart portrays the comparison between the amount of money spent by France and the UK, in 2010, on five consumer goods i.e. Cars, Computers, Books, Perfumes, and Cameras. The unit of measurement used to present the values is pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Most significantly, the total expenditure of the UK surpasses that of a France. The maximum amount of money spent by both the countries was on cars which amount to just above 450,000 and 400,000, respectively. Whereas, the minimum spending by the UK was on perfumes (Slightly less than 150,000) and by France it was on cameras (150,000).&lt;br&gt;
Getting into further depth, the items on which the spending by the UK was more than France were Cars, Books, and Cameras. On Cars, the UK spent 450,000 while France spent 400,000. Apart from that, the spending by the UK on Books and Cameras was just above then 400,000 and slightly above than 350,000, respectively, whereas, the spending by France on same items was 300,000 and 150,000, respectively. Collectively, the total spending by the UK on these three items was over 120,000 which was greater than France‚Äôs total 800,000.&lt;br&gt;
On the contrary, France (total over 550,000) exceeded the UK (total under 500,000) in terms of the spending on Computers and Perfumes. The amount of money spent by France on computers was above 350,000 as compared to 350,000 by the UK. Likewise, on Perfumes, France spent 200,000 while the UK spent less than 150,000.&lt;br&gt;P.s. I was unable to find pound sign on my keyboard so please consider it.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, &lt;br&gt;I find your blog super useful, thank you for taking the time to put all the elements needed to succeed on this exam. I‚Äôve been studied IELTS for almost two years now and have taken 3 exams so far; however, my writing score don‚Äôt seem to improve. After watching your video I had a bit of idea as of why this keep happening‚Ä¶ &lt;br&gt;The ‚Äútechniques‚Äù I‚Äôve been taught are very different from yours. I was told not to include any details on the introduction if I do I will lose points for that, as that must be part of the body. Also, the number of bodies will depend on the number of graph, meaning if I there is only one Bar chart I have to write only one body, if I write more I will lose marks. Of course summarising all details in one body will look messy. Basically, my writings look pretty much like this:&lt;br&gt;Introduction: The expenditure in France and the UK during 2010 is being depicted by the bar chart. &lt;br&gt;Body 1: As clearly seen, the x-axis contains the goods namely computers, perfumes, books among others, while the y-axis the amount spent in pounds. Then, I name the highest, lowest and order. &lt;br&gt;Conclusion‚Ä¶..&lt;br&gt;I honestly don‚Äôt know if this is one of the reasons I haven‚Äôt been able to get the score I need. I would appreciate your feedback, of course if you can give one.&lt;br&gt;Anyways, I have my test again in two weeks really hoping to get the score I need by following your recommendations. &lt;br&gt;Thank you so much again. üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Your introduction should help the reader know what the bar chart is about. If it is about the expenditure on goods, then introduce how many goods or name them. This information helps the reader understand the body paragraphs better. The name of each category is not a key feature, it is a factual element of the chart which the reader needs to know. So, always introduce names, categories, dates and another fact given about the chart.&lt;br&gt;
Body paragraphs can be used to divide categories into logical groups to help the reader understand the content and key features better.&lt;br&gt;
The overview is the most important paragraph. It does not repeat main points like a conclusion in task 2, it presents key features in a summary for the first and only time.&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt;
this page will help you with task 2: &lt;br&gt;
And my store contains advanced lessons and e-books for writing task 2: &lt;br&gt;Is it a good or bad idea to write something derived from what‚Äôs given on the chart? For example when mentioning the French expenditure on perfumes if I write&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúFrance‚Äôs 200,000 pounds expense on perfume was also higher than the UK which stood at around 100,000 pounds in the same category. Well, The French do have more admiration for scents.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;I love your ideas. Unfortunately, the answer is a big NO. Writing task 1 is a factual report based on what information is given, not on your perceptions, your opinion or your knowledge. No information can be added that isn‚Äôt given in the task.&lt;br&gt;Hello mam,&lt;br&gt;

This large production was also evident to other energy sources as gas, petro and nuclear. Whereas, there was only least production came from other source.&lt;br&gt;Generally, the significant source of energy came from coal with 29.80% in 1995 and over a third after ten years. It was also worth noting that both gas and petro produced high energy over this time period. In detail, there was around 29-30% energy produced by gas in 1995 and 2005 respectively. Conversely, production from petro drastically dropped from 29.27% in 1995 to around 10% less in 2005.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, energy came nuclear and other source both dramatically rose in 2005. 6.40% comprised of nuclear in 1995, and 4% more ten years later. Similarly, a remarkable increase was also noted for the other source as it boomed and doubled pushing its figure from 4.90% to 9.10%.&lt;br&gt;I must say that I was lucky to have come across Liz‚Äôs content on YouTube few minutes ago.

I have received my IELTS result and I have scored pretty much a good band score. I have followed all your lessons, videos, and all the content you have made us available for. A few months ago I have started preparing for IELTS from your lessons and believe me mam this is the best platform to learn for IELTS. All the small and tricky tips you have taught were very very useful and helped me to score a good band score. Thank you mam for your teachings and guidance.Respect for you.&lt;br&gt;Great to hear your news! Well done üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the annual spending of France and the United Kingdom on five types of consumer items in 2010 measured in pounds sterling. Overall, the United Kingdom spent a bigger amount of money on these commodities compared to France, whereas the expenditure on cars is the highest out of the other four consumer goods.&lt;br&gt;Initially, the UK people expend more on cars than French, about L450,000 and L400,000 respectively. Likewise, books are the other commodities where UK people spent more compared to French, with around L300,000 and L400,000 respectively. Similarly, people in the UK expend about L350,000 on cameras, significantly higher compared to French with around L200,000 difference.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, the budget of French people on computers above L350,000, which was slightly higher than the counterpart. People of France also spent their money at about L200,000 at that year on perfume, considerably higher than the UK people who only spent under L150,000.&lt;br&gt;Hello liz, I am an English teacher in a country where English is used as a second language. I really find interest in your video classes. All classes are full of meaning lessons. Not only that, every minutes of your classes is important. Thanks a lot for your efforts to us. We are really grateful to you.&lt;br&gt;
Love&lt;br&gt;
Saiful Sarker&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your message. I love to hear from a fellow teacher. I‚Äôm glad you find my lessons useful üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz! I prefer listening to your videos because you deliver each lesson very clearly. Your tips helped me a lot. I will be having my IELTS soon, it will be computer-delivered and I would like to know if there would be an automatic word count on where we will be doing our writing task?&lt;br&gt;Most people report having a word count option on the computer based test. However, don‚Äôt rely on it being there. There may be variations based on country or test centre. Good luck in your test üôÇ&lt;br&gt;In which tense we should write if not any dates are given in any charts. mainly in bar charts.&lt;br&gt;If there are no dates and the description doesn‚Äôt refer to the past or future, then you should use the present.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I just want to know that overview should be written in last or after introduction?&lt;br&gt;Both places are fine.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
The challenge in writing task 1 is the time allocated to write about the graph and figures. Within only 20 minutes, you are supposed to analyze the information, identify the key features, think of how to paraphrase the topic for the introduction and create different ways of comparing the data in the graph, not to mention being at pain to invent some cohesive devices for your writing. Do you think an English native speaker can do this with ease? Thanks a lot&lt;br&gt;Yes, if you train to do it. Each particular type of task 1 has its own approach and its own way of presenting data. All you need to do is learn the techniques for each type.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm grateful for all that you shareü§ó&lt;br&gt;Exactly my point but I think with constant practice, it wont be an issue.May God help us all,Amen.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, Can I use present tense always while writing in task 1 even though it talks about the past years in the graph?&lt;br&gt;Grammar is 25% of your marks and that includes using the right tense. If it is in the past, you should use past tense.&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount spent by France and the UK on consumer goods for the year 2010. The units are measured in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, both France and the UK spent maximum amount on the cars, while the minimum amount was spent on perfume by the UK, whereas, France spent minimum on cameras.&lt;br&gt;
From the observation, the expenditure of the UK was higher for cars, books and cameras as compared to France. The UK spent around 450,000 pounds on cars, whereas, 400,000 pounds was spent by France. The difference of 100,000 pounds was seen on the expenditure of books where the British spent just above 400,000 pounds. The UK spent around 350,000 pounds on cameras which is the double the amount as the French spent.&lt;br&gt;
On contrary, France paid higher the amount on computers and perfume as compared to the UK. The amount spent by French was below 400,000 pounds while the UK spent 350,000 pounds on computers. Just below 150,000 pounds was paid on perfume by the British, whereas, France expenditure was 200,00 pounds.&lt;br&gt;‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much for your help&lt;br&gt;Will I be penalized for crossing the word limit on any of the writing tasks?&lt;br&gt;Your aim is to go over the word limit. See this page: &lt;br&gt;What if, when it goes more than 250 words for writing task 1 to explain the big charts.&lt;br&gt;You will be marked down. Your task is to present key information and trends. You must not get lost in small detail.&lt;br&gt;Thank very much, Liz&lt;br&gt;
This is very useful chart for IELTS writing task 1, Liz explains a way that everyone understands. Thank for shown us the way, Liz.&lt;br&gt;Khadar&lt;br&gt;
Hargeisa&lt;br&gt;
British Somaliland&lt;br&gt;You‚Äôre welcome üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Hi liz. Good luck!&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Wishing you all the best.&lt;br&gt;
can I use the sequence ( Introduction , Body paragraph A, Body paragraph B, Overall), instead of ( Introduction, Overall , Body paragraph A, Body Paragraph B) ?&lt;br&gt;
Thanks&lt;br&gt;
Stay blessed , stay safe.&lt;br&gt;Sure. See this page to learn about writing task 1 including paragraphing: &lt;br&gt;The bar graph compares the money expenses of the UK and France on five different goods in the year 2010. Overall, it is readily apparent that the UK spent more on consumer goods than in France. Other features that stand out most are the highest amount of money spent on cars for both countries while the least significant is perfume in the UK  and cameras in France.&lt;br&gt;In regard to cars, the UK expenditure was over 450,000 pounds, being higher than France by 50,000 pounds. Also, the figures for books were almost identical, with 400,000 pounds of expenses in the UK while 300,000 pounds in France. Interestingly, the number of expenditures on cameras in the UK was over 350,000 pounds, which outraced the amount in France with only 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;However, when it comes to computers, the figure for France, which was around 375,000 pounds, exceed the UK with about 25,000 pounds. Similarly, while perfume was the least important in the UK with only 140,000 pounds of expenses, France was much higher by 60,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;hi liz&lt;br&gt;
in ielts do they only ask ques on chart or is there more types can u plz tell me the types of ques they can ask&lt;br&gt;Go to the HOME page and open the link to Writing Task 1 ‚Äì you will find everything you need to know.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz!&lt;br&gt;
 ƒ∞s it okay not to use symbols ,if we do not know exactly how to write it? for ex ‚Äúpound sterling‚Äù instead of symbol&lt;br&gt;
thanks&lt;3&lt;br&gt;There are certain symbols which we nearly always use instead of a word, such as ¬£, $ and %. It is fine to use them. The only time we use ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù is when we are texting so it isn‚Äôt suitable for formal writing.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Is it informal when we use the brackets in this task?&lt;br&gt;It is completely normal for some stats to be presented in brackets in an IELTS task 1 report.&lt;br&gt;Hello, Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Is there a pounds sterling symbol provided on the keyboard during CBT?&lt;br&gt;
This refers to all other special symbols as well. I found the pounds sterling symbol eventually by guess, but this takes time which is precious during the exam.&lt;br&gt;This is a very good question which you can ask you test centre about. It important that you ask as many questions to them about their equipment before the test day so that you feel confident and prepared to go in and do your best. If you get an answer from them, let me know what it is. It‚Äôs always useful to see how test centres respond.&lt;br&gt;How to use word infographic in writing task 1&lt;br&gt;It is not a word that is needed in IELTS Writing task 1. Not at all needed.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz&lt;br&gt;
I have a doubt regarding the logic behind separation of  body paragraphs that do I have to follow a set of rules for the division ,or I can come up with my own logic. If I have to follow a certain logic then can you please tell me where can I find those set of rules.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you&lt;br&gt;
Yatharth Mishra&lt;br&gt;You are being marked on logical organisation which also helps group key information together. The bar chart above is a chart of comparison, so you look for categories to compare which have similar key features. This is the logical way to organise this report. The organisation is also highlighted in the overview by stressing the key features which will inevitably be used to structure the paragraphs. There are no set rules ‚Äì you need to interpret the data, spot similarities and differences and organise accordingly. This is what you are being tested on as part of the marking criterion of Coherence and Cohesion which counts for 25% of your marks.&lt;br&gt;Hi Lizz! Can we leave space between every paragraph mean when we done with introduction so can we leave one line between each parargraph?&lt;br&gt;
Like introduction then one line space after that ‚Äúoverview‚Äù then one line space after that ‚Äù body paragraphs‚Äù.. Is it right way to write an essay??&lt;br&gt;This is the recommended way for both task 1 and task 2 writing. It helps make the paragraphs easy to see.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;I have a doubt in this paragraph, as you had said that we can‚Äôt use the same vocabulary more times but you have used ‚Äúexpenditure‚Äù 3 times is it correct?&lt;br&gt;can you please let me know how many times a vocab can be used in writing so that we don‚Äôt lose the marks.&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;
Love from India&lt;br&gt;Of course you can use words more than once. Some words will be repeated because they don‚Äôt have many options for paraphrasing. IELTS is not a trick test. Choose which words to paraphrasing and choosing how many paraphrases those words have. Not all words need to be changed.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
In the paragraph, you have written (was over double  that of France) is correct or it‚Äôs ( than of France)?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs correct. ‚Äúthat‚Äù refers to the amount.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much for your effort, your blog is really amazing. I have a question, you said in the listening section that either all the answers are written in capital letters or all of them are written in small letters, does that apply to the writing section as well ? I mean if I write my answers in capital letters in listening so even in writing section my answers have to be in capital ? Thanks in advance&lt;br&gt;For the writing test, you should write normally with grammatically correct use of capital letters. Your use of appropriate capital letters will be marked as part of the criterion for grammar.&lt;br&gt;Okay thank you so much&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much Liz for sharing all this for free. What are the differences, if any, between the writing of general and academic tests?&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;Please go to the RED MENU BAR and open the drop down options for Test Info. You will find a page for GT and Academic differences.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz&lt;br&gt;Thanks liz mam you are ossomm.  Your  ideas are extremely  helpful for ielts  students..&lt;br&gt;Can i use moreover ,however,buy ,yet ,in addition to .in tast 1&lt;br&gt;Yes, you can. You can see some of them used in my model answers on this page: &lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, first of all I wanted to thank you for your amazing help!&lt;br&gt;
I also wanted to ask if it is okay not to write a conclusion, which I‚Äôm used to doing both in English and in my mother tongue, if I write the overview first. Do you think I‚Äôd lose points if I write both an overview and at the end a conclusion? (not with the same words/ exact content)&lt;br&gt;Thank you in advanceüòô&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt; There‚Äôs a video about an overview/conclusion.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;Is it okay if I put some details in bullet points under one of the paragraph in writing task 1?&lt;br&gt;
For example‚Ä¶&lt;br&gt;
I request he hotel manager to provide the below mentioned details.&lt;br&gt;
  1. what kind of services your company offer?&lt;br&gt;
  2 . what kind of rooms available your hotel?&lt;br&gt;
  3‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;
  4‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;
  5‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;Is it okay to use such structure?&lt;br&gt;You are being marked on grammar. Sentence structures are 25% of your marks ‚Äì no notes, no bullet points. Just paragraphs and full sentences exactly the same as I have in my model answers.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Thanks again for your amazing website. My question is that is it okay to have an overview without any data given? For example here, it just shows the key features and the data are only included in the next body paragraphs.&lt;br&gt;Most overviews present key features rather than data. The only time I might include data in an overview is if the total is given with a table ‚Äì but that isn‚Äôt a rule, it‚Äôs just my way of tackling things.&lt;br&gt;/* Please  let me know my weakness so i can upgrade myself*/&lt;br&gt;The bar diagram manifests the information regarding spending of two countries (France and UK ) on top five accessories(cars, computers, books, perfumes and cameras) in 2010. Units are measured in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the trend of spending money in UK was higher than that of France. Also, cars were most popular items  in both of these countries as both of them spent lots of money on it. Incontrast, prefume was the less preferred product in UK where as it was camera in case of france.Furthermore, the  significant differences on expenditure between these two countries was on camera.&lt;br&gt;It can be seen that spending on  cars , books and cameras   were much more higher in UK comparing to France as they spend around $450000,  $400000  and $350000 respectivelly on it . However it was almost $400000, $ 300000  and $ 150000 accordingly in case of France.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, computers and perfumes were less preferred products in UK by contributing about $340000 and $150000 respectivelly  while people from france spent about $ 370000 and $200000 accordingly on it.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;I would like to know whether we can use merely instead of mere as shown in the above writing sample.&lt;br&gt;Is it correct to say&lt;br&gt;
: The energy produced by coal comprised of 29.80 % in the year 1995 and it showed a slight increase i.e. merely 1 percent in the year 2005.&lt;br&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;
Harpreet&lt;br&gt;‚Äúie‚Äù is when you are giving examples. There are no examples in writing task 1. There is actual data ‚Äì not examples of data. For this reason, your sentence is incorrect.&lt;br&gt;‚Äúie‚Äù refers to ‚Äòid est‚Äô in Latin, meaning ‚Äòthis is‚Äô or ‚Äòin other words‚Äô.&lt;br&gt;
‚Äúeg‚Äù refers to ‚Äòexempli gratia‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòfor example‚Äô.&lt;br&gt;
These are highly used in scientific writing, but I would avoid using them in IELTS as the examiner may get confused between the two.&lt;br&gt;The examiner would not get confused between the two at all. The reason you don‚Äôt use them is because you want to demonstrate your range of linking words ‚Äì such as, for example, to illustrate, namely etc ‚Äì this is about knowing the band scores, knowing marking criteria for IELTS and understanding how to maximise your score in the right way.&lt;br&gt;Honorable teacher,in paragraph 2 you used French and British,the name of the two nations  instead of their country‚Äôs name.In the question we can see ‚Äúthe expenditure of two countries‚Äù.The assertion does not mean that all those expenditure were made by the citizen of those countries.For example,in France some expenditure can be made by Spanish people.So why will we say them French expenditure?&lt;br&gt;Because it is standard language accepted in report writing. When we see figures for British exports ‚Äì it does not mean that all exports were by British citizens rather than the statistics come from the country.&lt;br&gt;Hii ma‚Äôam &lt;br&gt;Your way of teaching is quite fascinating, in other word so sweet.beside its seems that your all videos on youtube is so old so is there any mkst recent videos on writing or reading ??&lt;br&gt;The test has not changed. Those videos are 100% essential today.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz. Can we use ‚Äù (450.000 and 300.000 respectively)  ‚Äù to give details about money or numbers in real exam?&lt;br&gt;Any language used in my model answers is suitable for IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
 Your video are great and very useful. If possible can you give me an explanation on the usage of ‚Äúas opposed‚Äù and any other similar words which can boost my writing.&lt;br&gt;
I was fascinating, will it be good to add a conclusion part in the writing task?&lt;br&gt;
I have 4 days for  my exam. Can you please advise on how to plan my preparation?&lt;br&gt;Go to the writing task 1 section and writing task 2 section of this site for linking words and more. Use the RED MENU BAR.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for your tips, practice questions and model answers. It is beneficial.&lt;br&gt;
Also, while reading the model answer, I was confused about whether to use ‚Äúwas or were‚Äù in the last paragraph sentence ‚Äù spent by the French on computers was slightly more.‚Äù Does it hold the subject-verb agreement?&lt;br&gt;The word ‚Äúcomputers‚Äù is not the subject to the verb in that clause.&lt;br&gt;Thanks Liz&lt;br&gt;hello ma‚Äôam, I would love to know if the charts are also for the general test or just academics.&lt;br&gt;See this page and read the information carefully: &lt;br&gt;Is it okay to say ‚Äù Overall , the UK‚Äù to ‚Äù Overall , UK has spent‚Ä¶.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;‚Äúthe UK‚Äù is grammatically correct. ‚ÄúUK‚Äù without ‚Äúthe‚Äù is not correct. You need to learn which country names use ‚Äúthe‚Äù and which do not.&lt;br&gt;Then ‚Äúthe France‚Äù will be corrected or only France will be true?&lt;br&gt;‚ÄúFrance‚Äù does not have ‚Äúthe‚Äù in front of it. ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù does not have ‚Äúthe‚Äù in front of it. ‚ÄúThe UK‚Äù does. Please google this or check a grammar books.&lt;br&gt;I want to know if it is ok to write everything in Capital Letters in Computerized version of IELTS in Writing, Reading and Listening exam ?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs fine for listening and reading, but not recommended for writing. You need to show correct use of capital letters for the marking criterion of grammar in IELTS writing.&lt;br&gt;You are so cute mam. I think I m falling love with your assent . Thanks you for giving us such a knowledge about IELTS ‚Ä¶ I love you mam&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm glad you like my lessons üôÇ&lt;br&gt;I got the Cambridge guide to Ielts for my self study. In the writing section they have strictly mentioned that task 1 should have a maximum of 150 words and task 2 of 250 words. But here in your model answer the words are more than 200. I guess they have updated it. Just wanted you to know that.&lt;br&gt;And I even have a question. You said they count the currency symbol as a word so what about ),( and % ?.&lt;br&gt;You need to check the instructions again. The instructions are ‚Äúno less than 150 words‚Äù. 150 words for task 1 is a minimum ‚Äì not the maximum.&lt;br&gt;Hello mam,&lt;br&gt;
I think so word limit is exceeding&lt;br&gt;
Thankyou&lt;br&gt;Good organization of work. Have learnt something.&lt;br&gt;
But wanted to know the difference between pie and bar chart. Do the contents in the introduction and overview the same?&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt;Hello Miss less hope you are good&lt;br&gt;
 I have a doubt&lt;br&gt;
Can we use side topics or side headings such as introduction explanation for overview and finally for conclusion like this?&lt;br&gt;All task 1 reports and task 2 essays should be written exactly as shown in my model answers. If I don‚Äôt use headings, you don‚Äôt use headings.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;i‚Äôm not sure, if we can use the British and the French, since there are also foreigners live or travel and buy something as souvenirs there, like book and perfume. The chart only ilustrates the amount of money spent on consumer goods in two countries, without dividing the consumer. What do you think?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs fine to do this in IELTS.&lt;br&gt;But UK and Britain are not the same, Britain along with Northern Ireland is a part of UK  so you can not call the people of whole UK British.&lt;br&gt;
Does that effect the score though?&lt;br&gt;You are confusing ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù and ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù. The nationality of all people in the UK is British. They are all British citizens. However, people from England call themselves English and people from Scotland call themselves Scottish ‚Äì regardless ‚Äì they are still legally British citizens ‚Äì that is their formal nationality. If you are unsure of nationalities, please review them carefully for task 1.&lt;br&gt;i,m sorry maam but i think that money is countable while milk.water,oil,etc are uncountable. correct me if i,m wrong.thanks&lt;br&gt;That is not correct. We never have ‚Äúa money‚Äù. The word ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is uncountable.&lt;br&gt;Hi dear Lis&lt;br&gt;isnt it wrong using on the other hand without mentioning on one hand?&lt;br&gt;IT is completely fine to do that. It‚Äôs fine to use ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù without ‚Äúon the one hand‚Äù. But you can‚Äôt use ‚Äúon the one hand‚Äù without ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù.&lt;br&gt;Greeting, liz!&lt;br&gt;thank you for remarkable example for wrting task 1 but i have one question. If i followed this method exactly like what you did for the concept. Will i acquire a 9 score for sure?&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;Your score is based on Task Achievement (the key features you choose and how you group information), Coherence &amp; Cohesion, Vocabulary and Grammar. So, just following a structure is only one part of one criterion. You must show skills in all four areas and have excellent language skills to get band 9.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz, quick question. The last paragraph looks a bit long without any comma or full stop. It‚Äôs that OK?&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm not sure which paragraph you are referring to. The last paragraph is:&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the amount of money paid out on the remaining goods was higher in France. Above ¬£350,000 was spent by the French on computers which was slightly more than the British who spent exactly ¬£350,000. Neither of the countries spent much on perfume which accounted for ¬£200,000 of expenditure in France but under ¬£150,000 in the UK.&lt;br&gt;It has three sentences in it. Is this the paragraph you mean?&lt;br&gt;Greetings, Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Is it necessary to begin the overview with the word ‚Äòoverall‚Äô? Is there no other alternative?&lt;br&gt;regards&lt;br&gt;
Joy&lt;br&gt;IT is the best word to use that indicates an overview. Remember this is a factual report, not creative writing. You don‚Äôt get a higher score because you used a different word. You get a higher score because you avoid errors and use language appropriately.&lt;br&gt;hi liz, is it allowed to leave one empty line to start a new paragraph in writing tasks? thanks&lt;br&gt;IT is recommended to do that.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liza , I have a doubt that the prepositions will be count as a word or not . Please reply me struggling with this doubt!&lt;br&gt;All words are counted ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt matter how big or how small or if they are in brackets ‚Äì all words. (20 words).&lt;br&gt;So we should leave one empty line between paragraphs?&lt;br&gt;It is the best way to make the paragraphs easy for the examiner to read.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Mam. ,,,,,You are really a very good teacher. ,,,,,,, God bless you more and more,,,,,&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz&lt;br&gt;
I‚Äôm Hamid and I‚Äôm an English teacher.&lt;br&gt;
I really find your tips and videos very useful and perfect.&lt;br&gt;

Hamid&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I just wanted to thank you for your effort.&lt;br&gt;
I used your website for a week to study and I must say the content is very useful. I did the test today and I feel really good about it. I will get the results in 2 weeks.&lt;br&gt;Do share your result here when you got it. Thanks!",https://ieltsliz.com/ielts-model-bar-chart-band-score-9/?replytocom=2965130
Nora,"Dear Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. My friend sent me the link to your blog when I was desperate. As soon as I realized I had figured it out, I turned into a huge ‚ÄúI GOT IT!‚Äù.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much. Your explanation is clear, simple, and to the point.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm so pleased for you. Those moments of ‚ÄúI got it!‚Äù are so important. I want everyone to realise that you can tackle IELTS, but you need to avoid over-thinking. IELTS is, in some ways, quite a logical test. But in the beginning it seems confusing and then there is bad advice online. Anyway, I‚Äôm pleased for you. I hope you continue to use all pages on my free website and eventually achieve the score you want. I‚Äôll keep my fingers crossed for you üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount of money that is spent on different consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume, cameras) in France and the UK in the year 2010. Units measured for the money is pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the most money that is spent by France and the UK are on cars and least is on cameras and perfumes respectively. We can say that that UK has spent more money in consumer goods than France. The expenditure on the cameras has significant difference in France and in the UK.&lt;br&gt;The cars, computers and the cameras were most spent on, in the UK around 450000-pound sterling, similarly France also spent most of their money on cars and computers but unlike UK it didn‚Äôt spend on cameras but on books, which is around 300,000-to-400,000-pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Coming to the least amount of expenditure on the goods, France spent it‚Äôs least amount of money on cameras and UK spent it‚Äôs least on perfumes. Cameras were one of the highest expenditures of UK in the year 2010 but were the least for France. Their difference significantly amounts to approximately 150,000 pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount of pounds sterling which were spent by Fance and U.K for goods such as cars, computers, books ,perfume and cameras in 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, France spend more money on computers and perfume, meanwhile U.K were much interested in cars, books, and cameras.&lt;br&gt;The expenditure rate of France for cars and computers was close about 400,000 pound sterling, with 25,000 difference. Meanwhile, for perfume and cameras France spent half as much as that for cars around 200,000 and 50,000 less for cameras.&lt;br&gt;The U.K hold a record for highest expenditure in the chart for cars which is around 450,000, also they spent for books as much as France for cars. In addition, computers and cameras rate of expenditure was the same 350,000 pound sterling. While the least amount was spent on perfume about 140,000 pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I was most scared of writing task and i scored 7.5 and 8 overall.&lt;br&gt;
You articles and topics helped me a lot in achieving this score.&lt;br&gt;Great results! Very well done to you! Thanks for coming back to share your results üôÇ&lt;br&gt;I have no idea how to check my writings. Are there any problems with my writing:&lt;br&gt;
The bar chart illustrates the spending of France and UK on five different goods in 2010. &lt;br&gt;Overall, in both countries the highest expenditure was on cars, while perfumes accounted for the lowest in the UK and the cameras had the lowest figure for France. Moreover, while the UK expenditure on cars, books and cameras was more than France, French spent more on computers and perfumes. &lt;br&gt;Expenditure on cars stands at 450,000 for the UK, and this figure, standing at 400,000, is slightly smaller for France. Likewise, while the British spent 400,000 pounds on books, French spent only 300,000 on this category. In terms of cameras, the figures show that spending of UK with just over 350,000 was more than double the rate for France with 150,000 pounds. &lt;br&gt;In contrast, French spent more on computers and perfumes. Expenditure of computers stands at approximately 380,000 for French, which is slightly more than the amount spent by British standing at 350.000. Likewise, expenses of perfume for France was 200,000 pounds, while it was less than 150,000 for the UK.&lt;br&gt;I don‚Äôt usually give feedback, but I will say it‚Äôs a strong piece of writing with the right structure and techniques. However, do make sure to list the categories in the introduction ‚Äì it‚Äôs important to introduce them before you refer to them. Of course, if the list if very long, you might not. But this list is short, so it is a good idea to introduce them. Also check your linking words ‚Äì you have a tendency to repeat them which will lower your score. Linking words are very easy to learn and it isn‚Äôt difficult to be flexible with them if you pay attention while you are writing. For example, you can use ‚Äúsimilarly‚Äù, ‚Äúalthough‚Äù, ‚Äúwhereas‚Äù, ‚Äúas opposed to‚Äù, ‚Äúin comparison to‚Äù etc. Lastly, pay attention to your tenses ‚Äúexpenditure on cars stands at‚Äù = ‚Äústood at‚Äù ‚Äì this is in 2010 so you need past tense. You also need to review the accuracy of your grammar as a whole.&lt;br&gt;Thanks a million, it was very helpful and I never thought I would get a feedback from you. I‚Äôm sending you all my best wishes for a swift recovery. I truly hope your illness fades away so you can be back to your healthy self soon.&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;Thanks a million. Well noted.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the spending on 5 consumer goods, namely cars, computers, books, perfumes and cameras, of France and the U.K. in the year 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the expenditure of the British was higher than that of the French. Both Britain and France spent the most money on cards. The British spent the least money on perfume compared to the French whose expenditure on cameras was the least.&lt;br&gt;Regarding the expenditure on cards, the British spent slightly more than ¬£450,000 while the French spent exactly ¬£400,000 on this. The U.K. spent over ¬£400,000 on books as opposed to ¬£300,000 spent by France. The amount of money spend on cameras by the U.K. was more than twice as the amount spent by France, which was over ¬£350,000 and ¬£150,000 respectively.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the French spent marginally more than ¬£350,000 on computers than the British did (¬£350,000). For the amount of money spent on perfumes, ¬£200,000 was spent by the French which was more than the British who spent less than ¬£150,000.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the consumer goods preferences of two countries (France and the UK) in 2010.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, cars and computers were the most consumed goods in both countries, with perfume being the least preferred. However, the UK had the highest expenditure on all goods when compared to France.&lt;br&gt;
The UK has spent more money on cars, books, and computers, respectively, when compared with France, which has fewer expenditures. Furthermore, the UK used more cars than France, and the difference is nearly 50,000 pounds sterling. In addition, the UK spent a significantly higher portion than France, and the difference was worth nearly a hundred thousand pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, the UK spent more on cameras, which are worth more than 350,000 pounds sterling, but France spent less on them, which cost 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;
In contrast, expenditure on computers was the only thing France spent over the UK; it was closer to 400,000 pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the money spend on the consumer goods (cars, computers , books, perfume and  cameras ) in UK and France in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it is clear that UK and France both spend most on cars while least on perfume in UK and cameras in France. The major difference was found on cameras .&lt;br&gt;
UK spend 450, 000 pounds on cars which is higher than France (400,000). UK spend more than France on books which is 400,000 pounds. (1000 pounds more than France). Likewise UK spend half 350,000 on cameras while France spend half less than UK on cameras (15,000).&lt;br&gt;
France spend more than UK on 2 items ( computer and perfume). France spend more than 350,000 on computers while UK spend exactly 350, 000 on computers. Similarly, France spend 200,000 pounds on perfume which is higher than UK‚Äôs expenditure i.e about 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume, cameras) in France and UK in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the UK spent more money on consumer goods than France in the year 2010. Both the British and French spent most of their money on cars where as the least amount of money was spent on perfume in UK compared to cameras in France. Furthermore, the most significant difference between both the countries in expenditure was on cameras.&lt;br&gt;In terms of cars, people in UK spent about 450,000 pounds sterlings as opposed to the French at 400000 pounds. Similarly British expenditure was more than double on cameras as compared to France (around 350,000 and 150,000 respectively). Whereas in France expenditure on perfumes (about 200000) was more than that of UK, which was under 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the amount of money spent on computers was more in France ( around 370,000 pounds) than that in UK, which was 350,000 pounds. There was a huge difference in expenditure on books between both the countries, which was around 400,000 pounds in UK and 300,000 in France.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart demonstrates the average spending on five types of consumer goods  in France  and the UK in 2010.&lt;br&gt;Overall, except for computers and perfume, the amount of money used for buying consumer goods in the UK was higher than that of France. Among the five categories, the expenditure on cars was always the highest in both countries.&lt;br&gt;Looking at the data of France, while the French spent 400,000 pounds on cars, this figure for perfume was 50% lower, at merely 200,000 pounds. As compared to cars, the expenditures for computers and books were slightly lower, with respective figures being 380,000 and 300,000 pounds. Besides, only 150,000 pounds were spent on camera, being the lowest consumer spending among the five kinds of goods.&lt;br&gt;Turning to the UK‚Äô statistic, it can be seen that the amount of money used for paid out on cars was over 450,000 pounds, and a third of it was the figure for perfume. Another noticeable feature is that the UK residents spent an equal amount of money on computers and cameras, which was approximately 350,000 pounds each.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôll leave similar feedback to a previous comment. Bar charts present categories as two bars so that those two bars can be compared together side by side. The two bars are France and the UK. This means you don‚Äôt separate the countries, you compare them.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much, I‚Äôve noted&lt;br&gt;greetings Liz,a question ;Is a symbol counted as a word&lt;br&gt;The symbol forms part of a number. For example, ‚Äú75%‚Äù is counted as one number in the writing test.&lt;br&gt;Wonderful explanation! Thank you liz.I love you from my heart for your amazing teaching method.&lt;br&gt;Glad you enjoy my lessons üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the national spending on five consumer commodities(cars,computers,books,perfumes and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010. Unit is in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the UK and france spent the most on cars. In France, the least expenditure was on cameras, while in the UK it was on perfumes. In total, the outlay of the UK was more than France.&lt;br&gt;
The information given indicates that the national spending on conusmer goods in france declined across all the categories with more expenses on cars(450,000 pounds). This amount was more than double the payments on cameras(180,000 pounds) which had  the lowest outlay for France.&lt;br&gt;
In contrast, the national expenditure of the UK fluctuated during this period,with most of it(400,000 pounds) alloted to  cars this was similar to France allotment on books for the period.The least payment for the UK was on perfumes(), with a slight difference in pay outs on computer by both countries respectively(350,000, 370,000) pounds.&lt;br&gt;please liz kindly rate my writing thanks for the efforts you have put into this  blog, am from Nigeria and am using your blog to study for my IELTS exam coming up in 2weeks.&lt;br&gt;The sentences ‚ÄúUnits are measured in ‚Ä¶‚Äù is always plural. The information about consumer spending in France declining over all categories, is an overview and belongs in the overview. When you describe a trend over the whole period without specific amounts put that information in the overview.&lt;br&gt;
A bar chart is about comparing the countries within the category ‚Äì exactly as shown in the chart. You describe, for example, cars and compare the spending of France and the UK in that category. You must respect the function of the bar chart and how the information is present in the chart.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, don‚Äôt use brackets all the time for the numbers. Your aim is to show how flexible you are with your sentence structures.&lt;br&gt;I have noted all the corrections you have said.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart compares the amount of money spent on the five various goods ( cars, computers, books, cameras) in 2010 in two Europeian countries (France and UK)&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it can be easily seen that UK has spent more money on cars, books and cameras. Also, The considerable difference between 2 countries was on cameras.&lt;br&gt;
To begin with chorus, UK has spent about 50000¬£ more than France showing 450000¬£. Above 350000¬£ was spent on computers in France. Similarly with cars, aproximately 400000¬£ has been spent on computer by UK in 2010&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand British expenditure was higher than France ( about 400000¬£ and 300000¬£ respectively). In both countries the amount of money spent on perfume was low which accounted 200000¬£ in France and just under 150000¬£ in UK. Camerad was one of the most popular item in Britian reaching just above 350000¬£ while France has the lowest point 150000¬£ in 2010&lt;br&gt;The chart below depicts the information about the spending on household items in United Kingdom and France in 2010.&lt;br&gt;
After analyzing the graph, it can be seen clearly that France spent 400,000 pound on cars in 2011 being greater than UK in same year. Total expenditure on computers in France was 375000 in given year. The money spent by France on remaining three goods (books, perfumes and cameras) was less than the first two items, which were 300,000,200,000 and 150,000 respectively.&lt;br&gt;
The graph further collate that the expenditure of UK on cars was around 460,000 pounds in 2011. However, UK spending on computers was less than France by about 350,000. After cars, books were the most consumed items in UK with around 410,000 pounds. Perfume was least consumed item by people of UK by approximately 140,000 pounds. UK spent almost double on cameras than France by about 360,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, France showed a downward trend and UK had some fluctuations in his expenditure on consumers goods.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Isn‚Äôt this answer a little above 200 words? Is it fine to write so much?&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;There is no word limit for any writing task in IELTS. However, longer answers might be less focused, contain more irrelevant information and could contain a greater density of language errors. I recommend all candidates to aim for between 170 and 190 words. However, I also like to show flexibility of options for people with higher level English and excellent IELTS exam skills&lt;br&gt;In many nations only a small group of individuals receive very high salaries. Few people debate that this is beneficial for the country and other‚Äôs think that government should put limits on salary.&lt;br&gt;Firstly, huge salaries are received by people with exceptional talent and the person who is doing that job may play a crucial role in the company‚Äôs or nations development, for instance in my country highest salaries are received by company ceo‚Äôs, and other government individuals like scientist, Ias officers etc. In my opinion it is justified giving them huge salaries because to get that position they must have worked very hard.By giving higer salaries one nation can potrait it‚Äôs economical strength and preserve its own talent, for example most of the students from russia with huge talent mostly tend to work in there country.&lt;br&gt; However, others believe that government should implement certain rules to limit the salaries received by a individual person. Mostly people believe that giving such a huge amount pf salaries to a single person can effect overall companies or government expenditure, also they think that poor and middle class families remain same. This also effects in pandemic time, for example in the USA due to inflation most of the common people became homeless, and the one who received higher salaries were able sustain that. There is always a difference between high salary employe and low salaried, due this per capita income is varied.&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, every individual has their own opinion, but according to me  putting restrictions on salaries can effect the overall development and If government implements certain rules then most of them will migrate to other countries for better life, instead government should bring more employment opportunities to improve overall employment rate and GDP.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, &lt;br&gt;Thank you for your lessons and materials. I noticed on the website that you advise sticking to the official British Council information for the test. I have a question related to this. In the official ‚ÄòRoad to IELTS‚Äô advice and tutorials for Writing Task 1 (IELTS Academic), the instructors suggest structuring the text as follows:&lt;br&gt;‚Äì Introduction&lt;br&gt;
‚Äì Body paragraphs&lt;br&gt;
‚Äì Overview (as a sort of concluding paragraph)&lt;br&gt;From your videos, you seem to suggest placing the ‚ÄòOverview‚Äô paragraph right after the ‚ÄòIntroduction,‚Äô which makes sense, and I agree with you on that. What is your opinion on this matter? Is the placement of the ‚ÄòOverview‚Äô paragraph interchangeable (meaning we won‚Äôt lose marks if it is positioned at the beginning of the text)?&lt;br&gt;Yes, it‚Äôs interchangeable. I have a video about this. Some people choose to put it at the end as a kind of conclusion. But the function of a conclusion is to restate main points. An overview doesn‚Äôt have this function. The overview actually states the main features for the first and only time, which is why putting it after the introduction is best. Secondly, when you put it at the end, people have a tendency to not pay much attention to its contents. What a mistake! It‚Äôs the most important paragraph in the whole of task 1. However, it‚Äôs position can be put in either place without impacting your marks. But always be aware of not prioritising it or repeating information if you choose to put it at the end.&lt;br&gt;Liz, in terms of numbers, is it a big deal to write 40.000 (forty thousand, as an example) with the point rather than with a comma? (Eg: 40,000)&lt;br&gt;What is the norm in English here? (Or otherwise, Maths‚Ä¶)&lt;br&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;br&gt;In English, the dot is used as a decimal point which would make 40.000 an actual number of just 40. We use commas to divide zeros for big numbers.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Units were measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Would it be wrong if I use past tense in this sentence??&lt;br&gt;
Thank You&lt;br&gt;We use the present tense for this statement because it refers to the graph currently in front of you.&lt;br&gt;The bar charts compare the amount of money spent on different groups of goods (cars, computers, books, perfume and cameras) in 2010 in France and the UK. Units are measured in pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be clearly seen that the British in general spent more money than the French. The biggest expenditure for both countries was on cars, whereas the lowest for the UK was perfume and for France cameras.&lt;br&gt;In terms of the outlay of the UK, most of the money was paid for cars and books (just over 45,000 and 400,00 respectively). The expenditure on cameras and computers was almost equal at nearly 350,000, whereas the lowest amount of money was spent on perfume (under 150,000), which was at least 2 times less than on other goods.   &lt;br&gt;Moving on to the situation in France, they spent the majority of money on cars as in the UK, however their expenditure was by 50,000 less. In contrast, the French paid slightly more than the British for computers, which was followed by the outlay for books (nearly 380,000 and 300,000 respectively). Finally, perfume was ranked fourth at 200,000, followed by the least group in terms of expenditure, cameras, at 150,000, which was twice as less as the British paid for them.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart illustrates the amount spent on five consumer goods (Cars, Computers, Books, Perfume, Cameras) in France and UK in the year 2010. Units are given in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, UK and France both spent most of their money in Cars. However, the least amount of money spent by UK was on Perfume whereas in case of France was Cameras. Furthermore, the most significant difference in expenditure between France and UK was Cameras.&lt;br&gt;Looking specifically at France, the figure shows it spent 400,000 pounds in Cars. Similarly, the expenditure of France on Perfume and Computers were 200,000 pound and about 375,000 pounds respectively which exceeded the expenditure spent by UK on both the goods. Moreover, The amount spent by France on Books was 300,000 which was double the expenditure on Cameras.&lt;br&gt;Regarding UK, Cars were the goods which UK spent most, with 450,000 pounds. The amount of 350,000 was paid out on Computers which was slightly less than the amount France invested. UK spent slightly little more than 400000 pounds on Books. Similarly, the expenditure of Cameras was slightly more than 350,000 pounds. However, the least expenditure spent was on the Perfume which was almost 150,000.&lt;br&gt;The bar chart provides data about money spent by the UK and France on consumption goods in the year of 2010. Unit of money is pounds sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, both France and the UK spent most on cars.The UK‚Äôs expenditure on cameras was roughly twice as large as France‚Äôs.&lt;br&gt;Looking specifically at France, the amount of money spent on cars accounted for 400000, which was the highest in France.After cars, comes computers to a close second at around 380000.On the contrary, the least amount of funds was disbursed on cameras at exactly 150000, which is twice as little as the UK‚Äôs expenditure on cameras.&lt;br&gt;With respect to the UK,  it, like Fance, also had cars as the consumption goods on which the highest amount of funds was expended, which accounted for about 460000.Books was the second consumer item after cars on which the largest expenditure was made at around 410000.In contrast, the UK expended less than 150000 on perfume, which was the item on which the least expenditure made.&lt;br&gt;
Is the essay good enough?What band would it score?&lt;br&gt;The provided chart portrays the comparison between the amount of money spent by France and the UK, in 2010, on five consumer goods i.e. Cars, Computers, Books, Perfumes, and Cameras. The unit of measurement used to present the values is pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Most significantly, the total expenditure of the UK surpasses that of a France. The maximum amount of money spent by both the countries was on cars which amount to just above 450,000 and 400,000, respectively. Whereas, the minimum spending by the UK was on perfumes (Slightly less than 150,000) and by France it was on cameras (150,000).&lt;br&gt;
Getting into further depth, the items on which the spending by the UK was more than France were Cars, Books, and Cameras. On Cars, the UK spent 450,000 while France spent 400,000. Apart from that, the spending by the UK on Books and Cameras was just above then 400,000 and slightly above than 350,000, respectively, whereas, the spending by France on same items was 300,000 and 150,000, respectively. Collectively, the total spending by the UK on these three items was over 120,000 which was greater than France‚Äôs total 800,000.&lt;br&gt;
On the contrary, France (total over 550,000) exceeded the UK (total under 500,000) in terms of the spending on Computers and Perfumes. The amount of money spent by France on computers was above 350,000 as compared to 350,000 by the UK. Likewise, on Perfumes, France spent 200,000 while the UK spent less than 150,000.&lt;br&gt;P.s. I was unable to find pound sign on my keyboard so please consider it.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, &lt;br&gt;I find your blog super useful, thank you for taking the time to put all the elements needed to succeed on this exam. I‚Äôve been studied IELTS for almost two years now and have taken 3 exams so far; however, my writing score don‚Äôt seem to improve. After watching your video I had a bit of idea as of why this keep happening‚Ä¶ &lt;br&gt;The ‚Äútechniques‚Äù I‚Äôve been taught are very different from yours. I was told not to include any details on the introduction if I do I will lose points for that, as that must be part of the body. Also, the number of bodies will depend on the number of graph, meaning if I there is only one Bar chart I have to write only one body, if I write more I will lose marks. Of course summarising all details in one body will look messy. Basically, my writings look pretty much like this:&lt;br&gt;Introduction: The expenditure in France and the UK during 2010 is being depicted by the bar chart. &lt;br&gt;Body 1: As clearly seen, the x-axis contains the goods namely computers, perfumes, books among others, while the y-axis the amount spent in pounds. Then, I name the highest, lowest and order. &lt;br&gt;Conclusion‚Ä¶..&lt;br&gt;I honestly don‚Äôt know if this is one of the reasons I haven‚Äôt been able to get the score I need. I would appreciate your feedback, of course if you can give one.&lt;br&gt;Anyways, I have my test again in two weeks really hoping to get the score I need by following your recommendations. &lt;br&gt;Thank you so much again. üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Your introduction should help the reader know what the bar chart is about. If it is about the expenditure on goods, then introduce how many goods or name them. This information helps the reader understand the body paragraphs better. The name of each category is not a key feature, it is a factual element of the chart which the reader needs to know. So, always introduce names, categories, dates and another fact given about the chart.&lt;br&gt;
Body paragraphs can be used to divide categories into logical groups to help the reader understand the content and key features better.&lt;br&gt;
The overview is the most important paragraph. It does not repeat main points like a conclusion in task 2, it presents key features in a summary for the first and only time.&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt;
this page will help you with task 2: &lt;br&gt;
And my store contains advanced lessons and e-books for writing task 2: &lt;br&gt;Is it a good or bad idea to write something derived from what‚Äôs given on the chart? For example when mentioning the French expenditure on perfumes if I write&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúFrance‚Äôs 200,000 pounds expense on perfume was also higher than the UK which stood at around 100,000 pounds in the same category. Well, The French do have more admiration for scents.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;I love your ideas. Unfortunately, the answer is a big NO. Writing task 1 is a factual report based on what information is given, not on your perceptions, your opinion or your knowledge. No information can be added that isn‚Äôt given in the task.&lt;br&gt;Hello mam,&lt;br&gt;

I feel cloud of nine when I read your posts üòç Thanks for your attention to your followers üòá&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm so glad you are enjoying my website üôÇ&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five different consumer goods (cars, competes, books, perfume, and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010.

I really find interest in your video classes. All classes are full of meaning lessons. Not only that, every minutes of your classes is important. Thanks a lot for your efforts to us. We are really grateful to you.&lt;br&gt;
Love&lt;br&gt;
Saiful Sarker&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your message. I love to hear from a fellow teacher. I‚Äôm glad you find my lessons useful üôÇ&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz! I prefer listening to your videos because you deliver each lesson very clearly. Your tips helped me a lot. I will be having my IELTS soon, it will be computer-delivered and I would like to know if there would be an automatic word count on where we will be doing our writing task?&lt;br&gt;Most people report having a word count option on the computer based test. However, don‚Äôt rely on it being there. There may be variations based on country or test centre. Good luck in your test üôÇ&lt;br&gt;In which tense we should write if not any dates are given in any charts. mainly in bar charts.&lt;br&gt;If there are no dates and the description doesn‚Äôt refer to the past or future, then you should use the present.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I just want to know that overview should be written in last or after introduction?&lt;br&gt;Both places are fine.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
The challenge in writing task 1 is the time allocated to write about the graph and figures. Within only 20 minutes, you are supposed to analyze the information, identify the key features, think of how to paraphrase the topic for the introduction and create different ways of comparing the data in the graph, not to mention being at pain to invent some cohesive devices for your writing. Do you think an English native speaker can do this with ease? Thanks a lot&lt;br&gt;Yes, if you train to do it. Each particular type of task 1 has its own approach and its own way of presenting data. All you need to do is learn the techniques for each type.&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm grateful for all that you shareü§ó&lt;br&gt;Exactly my point but I think with constant practice, it wont be an issue.May God help us all,Amen.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, Can I use present tense always while writing in task 1 even though it talks about the past years in the graph?&lt;br&gt;Grammar is 25% of your marks and that includes using the right tense. If it is in the past, you should use past tense.&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount spent by France and the UK on consumer goods for the year 2010. The units are measured in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, both France and the UK spent maximum amount on the cars, while the minimum amount was spent on perfume by the UK, whereas, France spent minimum on cameras.&lt;br&gt;

The difference of 100,000 pounds was seen on the expenditure of books where the British spent just above 400,000 pounds. The UK spent around 350,000 pounds on cameras which is the double the amount as the French spent.&lt;br&gt;
On contrary, France paid higher the amount on computers and perfume as compared to the UK. The amount spent by French was below 400,000 pounds while the UK spent 350,000 pounds on computers. Just below 150,000 pounds was paid on perfume by the British, whereas, France expenditure was 200,00 pounds.&lt;br&gt;‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much for your help&lt;br&gt;Will I be penalized for crossing the word limit on any of the writing tasks?&lt;br&gt;Your aim is to go over the word limit. See this page: &lt;br&gt;What if, when it goes more than 250 words for writing task 1 to explain the big charts.&lt;br&gt;You will be marked down. Your task is to present key information and trends. You must not get lost in small detail.&lt;br&gt;Thank very much, Liz&lt;br&gt;
This is very useful chart for IELTS writing task 1, Liz explains a way that everyone understands. Thank for shown us the way, Liz.&lt;br&gt;Khadar&lt;br&gt;

Wishing you all the best.&lt;br&gt;
can I use the sequence ( Introduction , Body paragraph A, Body paragraph B, Overall), instead of ( Introduction, Overall , Body paragraph A, Body Paragraph B) ?&lt;br&gt;
Thanks&lt;br&gt;
Stay blessed , stay safe.&lt;br&gt;Sure. See this page to learn about writing task 1 including paragraphing: &lt;br&gt;The bar graph compares the money expenses of the UK and France on five different goods in the year 2010. Overall, it is readily apparent that the UK spent more on consumer goods than in France. Other features that stand out most are the highest amount of money spent on cars for both countries while the least significant is perfume in the UK  and cameras in France.&lt;br&gt;In regard to cars, the UK expenditure was over 450,000 pounds, being higher than France by 50,000 pounds. Also, the figures for books were almost identical, with 400,000 pounds of expenses in the UK while 300,000 pounds in France. Interestingly, the number of expenditures on cameras in the UK was over 350,000 pounds, which outraced the amount in France with only 150,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;However, when it comes to computers, the figure for France, which was around 375,000 pounds, exceed the UK with about 25,000 pounds. Similarly, while perfume was the least important in the UK with only 140,000 pounds of expenses, France was much higher by 60,000 pounds.&lt;br&gt;hi liz&lt;br&gt;
in ielts do they only ask ques on chart or is there more types can u plz tell me the types of ques they can ask&lt;br&gt;Go to the HOME page and open the link to Writing Task 1 ‚Äì you will find everything you need to know.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz!&lt;br&gt;
 ƒ∞s it okay not to use symbols ,if we do not know exactly how to write it? for ex ‚Äúpound sterling‚Äù instead of symbol&lt;br&gt;
thanks&lt;3&lt;br&gt;There are certain symbols which we nearly always use instead of a word, such as ¬£, $ and %. It is fine to use them. The only time we use ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù is when we are texting so it isn‚Äôt suitable for formal writing.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Is it informal when we use the brackets in this task?&lt;br&gt;It is completely normal for some stats to be presented in brackets in an IELTS task 1 report.&lt;br&gt;Hello, Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Is there a pounds sterling symbol provided on the keyboard during CBT?&lt;br&gt;
This refers to all other special symbols as well. I found the pounds sterling symbol eventually by guess, but this takes time which is precious during the exam.&lt;br&gt;This is a very good question which you can ask you test centre about. It important that you ask as many questions to them about their equipment before the test day so that you feel confident and prepared to go in and do your best. If you get an answer from them, let me know what it is. It‚Äôs always useful to see how test centres respond.&lt;br&gt;How to use word infographic in writing task 1&lt;br&gt;It is not a word that is needed in IELTS Writing task 1. Not at all needed.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz&lt;br&gt;
I have a doubt regarding the logic behind separation of  body paragraphs that do I have to follow a set of rules for the division ,or I can come up with my own logic. If I have to follow a certain logic then can you please tell me where can I find those set of rules.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you&lt;br&gt;
Yatharth Mishra&lt;br&gt;You are being marked on logical organisation which also helps group key information together. The bar chart above is a chart of comparison, so you look for categories to compare which have similar key features. This is the logical way to organise this report. The organisation is also highlighted in the overview by stressing the key features which will inevitably be used to structure the paragraphs. There are no set rules ‚Äì you need to interpret the data, spot similarities and differences and organise accordingly. This is what you are being tested on as part of the marking criterion of Coherence and Cohesion which counts for 25% of your marks.&lt;br&gt;Hi Lizz! Can we leave space between every paragraph mean when we done with introduction so can we leave one line between each parargraph?&lt;br&gt;
Like introduction then one line space after that ‚Äúoverview‚Äù then one line space after that ‚Äù body paragraphs‚Äù.. Is it right way to write an essay??&lt;br&gt;This is the recommended way for both task 1 and task 2 writing. It helps make the paragraphs easy to see.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;I have a doubt in this paragraph, as you had said that we can‚Äôt use the same vocabulary more times but you have used ‚Äúexpenditure‚Äù 3 times is it correct?&lt;br&gt;can you please let me know how many times a vocab can be used in writing so that we don‚Äôt lose the marks.&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;
Love from India&lt;br&gt;Of course you can use words more than once. Some words will be repeated because they don‚Äôt have many options for paraphrasing. IELTS is not a trick test. Choose which words to paraphrasing and choosing how many paraphrases those words have. Not all words need to be changed.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
In the paragraph, you have written (was over double  that of France) is correct or it‚Äôs ( than of France)?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs correct. ‚Äúthat‚Äù refers to the amount.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much for your effort, your blog is really amazing. I have a question, you said in the listening section that either all the answers are written in capital letters or all of them are written in small letters, does that apply to the writing section as well ? I mean if I write my answers in capital letters in listening so even in writing section my answers have to be in capital ? Thanks in advance&lt;br&gt;For the writing test, you should write normally with grammatically correct use of capital letters. Your use of appropriate capital letters will be marked as part of the criterion for grammar.&lt;br&gt;Okay thank you so much&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much Liz for sharing all this for free. What are the differences, if any, between the writing of general and academic tests?&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;Please go to the RED MENU BAR and open the drop down options for Test Info. You will find a page for GT and Academic differences.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Liz&lt;br&gt;Thanks liz mam you are ossomm.  Your  ideas are extremely  helpful for ielts  students..&lt;br&gt;Can i use moreover ,however,buy ,yet ,in addition to .in tast 1&lt;br&gt;Yes, you can. You can see some of them used in my model answers on this page: &lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, first of all I wanted to thank you for your amazing help!&lt;br&gt;
I also wanted to ask if it is okay not to write a conclusion, which I‚Äôm used to doing both in English and in my mother tongue, if I write the overview first. Do you think I‚Äôd lose points if I write both an overview and at the end a conclusion? (not with the same words/ exact content)&lt;br&gt;Thank you in advanceüòô&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt; There‚Äôs a video about an overview/conclusion.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;Is it okay if I put some details in bullet points under one of the paragraph in writing task 1?&lt;br&gt;
For example‚Ä¶&lt;br&gt;
I request he hotel manager to provide the below mentioned details.&lt;br&gt;
  1. what kind of services your company offer?&lt;br&gt;
  2 . what kind of rooms available your hotel?&lt;br&gt;
  3‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;
  4‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;
  5‚Ä¶.&lt;br&gt;Is it okay to use such structure?&lt;br&gt;You are being marked on grammar. Sentence structures are 25% of your marks ‚Äì no notes, no bullet points. Just paragraphs and full sentences exactly the same as I have in my model answers.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
Thanks again for your amazing website. My question is that is it okay to have an overview without any data given? For example here, it just shows the key features and the data are only included in the next body paragraphs.&lt;br&gt;Most overviews present key features rather than data. The only time I might include data in an overview is if the total is given with a table ‚Äì but that isn‚Äôt a rule, it‚Äôs just my way of tackling things.&lt;br&gt;/* Please  let me know my weakness so i can upgrade myself*/&lt;br&gt;The bar diagram manifests the information regarding spending of two countries (France and UK ) on top five accessories(cars, computers, books, perfumes and cameras) in 2010. Units are measured in pound sterling.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the trend of spending money in UK was higher than that of France. Also, cars were most popular items  in both of these countries as both of them spent lots of money on it. Incontrast, prefume was the less preferred product in UK where as it was camera in case of france.Furthermore, the  significant differences on expenditure between these two countries was on camera.&lt;br&gt;It can be seen that spending on  cars , books and cameras   were much more higher in UK comparing to France as they spend around $450000,  $400000  and $350000 respectivelly on it . However it was almost $400000, $ 300000  and $ 150000 accordingly in case of France.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, computers and perfumes were less preferred products in UK by contributing about $340000 and $150000 respectivelly  while people from france spent about $ 370000 and $200000 accordingly on it.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;I would like to know whether we can use merely instead of mere as shown in the above writing sample.&lt;br&gt;Is it correct to say&lt;br&gt;
: The energy produced by coal comprised of 29.80 % in the year 1995 and it showed a slight increase i.e. merely 1 percent in the year 2005.&lt;br&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;
Harpreet&lt;br&gt;‚Äúie‚Äù is when you are giving examples. There are no examples in writing task 1. There is actual data ‚Äì not examples of data. For this reason, your sentence is incorrect.&lt;br&gt;‚Äúie‚Äù refers to ‚Äòid est‚Äô in Latin, meaning ‚Äòthis is‚Äô or ‚Äòin other words‚Äô.&lt;br&gt;
‚Äúeg‚Äù refers to ‚Äòexempli gratia‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòfor example‚Äô.&lt;br&gt;
These are highly used in scientific writing, but I would avoid using them in IELTS as the examiner may get confused between the two.&lt;br&gt;The examiner would not get confused between the two at all. The reason you don‚Äôt use them is because you want to demonstrate your range of linking words ‚Äì such as, for example, to illustrate, namely etc ‚Äì this is about knowing the band scores, knowing marking criteria for IELTS and understanding how to maximise your score in the right way.&lt;br&gt;Honorable teacher,in paragraph 2 you used French and British,the name of the two nations  instead of their country‚Äôs name.In the question we can see ‚Äúthe expenditure of two countries‚Äù.The assertion does not mean that all those expenditure were made by the citizen of those countries.For example,in France some expenditure can be made by Spanish people.So why will we say them French expenditure?&lt;br&gt;Because it is standard language accepted in report writing. When we see figures for British exports ‚Äì it does not mean that all exports were by British citizens rather than the statistics come from the country.&lt;br&gt;Hii ma‚Äôam &lt;br&gt;Your way of teaching is quite fascinating, in other word so sweet.beside its seems that your all videos on youtube is so old so is there any mkst recent videos on writing or reading ??&lt;br&gt;The test has not changed. Those videos are 100% essential today.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz. Can we use ‚Äù (450.000 and 300.000 respectively)  ‚Äù to give details about money or numbers in real exam?&lt;br&gt;Any language used in my model answers is suitable for IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
 Your video are great and very useful. If possible can you give me an explanation on the usage of ‚Äúas opposed‚Äù and any other similar words which can boost my writing.&lt;br&gt;
I was fascinating, will it be good to add a conclusion part in the writing task?&lt;br&gt;
I have 4 days for  my exam. Can you please advise on how to plan my preparation?&lt;br&gt;Go to the writing task 1 section and writing task 2 section of this site for linking words and more. Use the RED MENU BAR.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for your tips, practice questions and model answers. It is beneficial.&lt;br&gt;
Also, while reading the model answer, I was confused about whether to use ‚Äúwas or were‚Äù in the last paragraph sentence ‚Äù spent by the French on computers was slightly more.‚Äù Does it hold the subject-verb agreement?&lt;br&gt;The word ‚Äúcomputers‚Äù is not the subject to the verb in that clause.&lt;br&gt;Thanks Liz&lt;br&gt;hello ma‚Äôam, I would love to know if the charts are also for the general test or just academics.&lt;br&gt;See this page and read the information carefully: &lt;br&gt;Is it okay to say ‚Äù Overall , the UK‚Äù to ‚Äù Overall , UK has spent‚Ä¶.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;‚Äúthe UK‚Äù is grammatically correct. ‚ÄúUK‚Äù without ‚Äúthe‚Äù is not correct. You need to learn which country names use ‚Äúthe‚Äù and which do not.&lt;br&gt;Then ‚Äúthe France‚Äù will be corrected or only France will be true?&lt;br&gt;‚ÄúFrance‚Äù does not have ‚Äúthe‚Äù in front of it. ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù does not have ‚Äúthe‚Äù in front of it. ‚ÄúThe UK‚Äù does. Please google this or check a grammar books.&lt;br&gt;I want to know if it is ok to write everything in Capital Letters in Computerized version of IELTS in Writing, Reading and Listening exam ?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs fine for listening and reading, but not recommended for writing. You need to show correct use of capital letters for the marking criterion of grammar in IELTS writing.&lt;br&gt;You are so cute mam. I think I m falling love with your assent . Thanks you for giving us such a knowledge about IELTS ‚Ä¶ I love you mam&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm glad you like my lessons üôÇ&lt;br&gt;I got the Cambridge guide to Ielts for my self study. In the writing section they have strictly mentioned that task 1 should have a maximum of 150 words and task 2 of 250 words. But here in your model answer the words are more than 200. I guess they have updated it. Just wanted you to know that.&lt;br&gt;And I even have a question. You said they count the currency symbol as a word so what about ),( and % ?.&lt;br&gt;You need to check the instructions again. The instructions are ‚Äúno less than 150 words‚Äù. 150 words for task 1 is a minimum ‚Äì not the maximum.&lt;br&gt;Hello mam,&lt;br&gt;
I think so word limit is exceeding&lt;br&gt;
Thankyou&lt;br&gt;Good organization of work. Have learnt something.&lt;br&gt;
But wanted to know the difference between pie and bar chart. Do the contents in the introduction and overview the same?&lt;br&gt;See this page: &lt;br&gt;Hello Miss less hope you are good&lt;br&gt;
 I have a doubt&lt;br&gt;
Can we use side topics or side headings such as introduction explanation for overview and finally for conclusion like this?&lt;br&gt;All task 1 reports and task 2 essays should be written exactly as shown in my model answers. If I don‚Äôt use headings, you don‚Äôt use headings.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;i‚Äôm not sure, if we can use the British and the French, since there are also foreigners live or travel and buy something as souvenirs there, like book and perfume. The chart only ilustrates the amount of money spent on consumer goods in two countries, without dividing the consumer. What do you think?&lt;br&gt;It‚Äôs fine to do this in IELTS.&lt;br&gt;But UK and Britain are not the same, Britain along with Northern Ireland is a part of UK  so you can not call the people of whole UK British.&lt;br&gt;
Does that effect the score though?&lt;br&gt;You are confusing ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù and ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù. The nationality of all people in the UK is British. They are all British citizens. However, people from England call themselves English and people from Scotland call themselves Scottish ‚Äì regardless ‚Äì they are still legally British citizens ‚Äì that is their formal nationality. If you are unsure of nationalities, please review them carefully for task 1.&lt;br&gt;i,m sorry maam but i think that money is countable while milk.water,oil,etc are uncountable. correct me if i,m wrong.thanks&lt;br&gt;That is not correct. We never have ‚Äúa money‚Äù. The word ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is uncountable.&lt;br&gt;Hi dear Lis&lt;br&gt;isnt it wrong using on the other hand without mentioning on one hand?&lt;br&gt;IT is completely fine to do that. It‚Äôs fine to use ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù without ‚Äúon the one hand‚Äù. But you can‚Äôt use ‚Äúon the one hand‚Äù without ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù.&lt;br&gt;Greeting, liz!&lt;br&gt;thank you for remarkable example for wrting task 1 but i have one question. If i followed this method exactly like what you did for the concept. Will i acquire a 9 score for sure?&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;Your score is based on Task Achievement (the key features you choose and how you group information), Coherence &amp; Cohesion, Vocabulary and Grammar. So, just following a structure is only one part of one criterion. You must show skills in all four areas and have excellent language skills to get band 9.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz, quick question. The last paragraph looks a bit long without any comma or full stop. It‚Äôs that OK?&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm not sure which paragraph you are referring to. The last paragraph is:&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the amount of money paid out on the remaining goods was higher in France. Above ¬£350,000 was spent by the French on computers which was slightly more than the British who spent exactly ¬£350,000. Neither of the countries spent much on perfume which accounted for ¬£200,000 of expenditure in France but under ¬£150,000 in the UK.&lt;br&gt;It has three sentences in it. Is this the paragraph you mean?&lt;br&gt;Greetings, Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Is it necessary to begin the overview with the word ‚Äòoverall‚Äô? Is there no other alternative?&lt;br&gt;regards&lt;br&gt;
Joy&lt;br&gt;IT is the best word to use that indicates an overview. Remember this is a factual report, not creative writing. You don‚Äôt get a higher score because you used a different word. You get a higher score because you avoid errors and use language appropriately.&lt;br&gt;hi liz, is it allowed to leave one empty line to start a new paragraph in writing tasks? thanks&lt;br&gt;IT is recommended to do that.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liza , I have a doubt that the prepositions will be count as a word or not . Please reply me struggling with this doubt!&lt;br&gt;All words are counted ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt matter how big or how small or if they are in brackets ‚Äì all words. (20 words).&lt;br&gt;So we should leave one empty line between paragraphs?&lt;br&gt;It is the best way to make the paragraphs easy for the examiner to read.&lt;br&gt;Thank you Mam. ,,,,,You are really a very good teacher. ,,,,,,, God bless you more and more,,,,,&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz&lt;br&gt;
I‚Äôm Hamid and I‚Äôm an English teacher.&lt;br&gt;
