.&lt;br&gt;Hello, Liz. Thanks for all these useful preparation materials. My question is, as I study academic writing task 1, I sometimes come across model answers with only one body paragraph, especially for questions that include tables. Is it okay to have only one body paragraph, or should we necessarily write a second one all the time?&lt;br&gt;The body must always be divided in to two or three paragraphs. This is part of how you distinguish categories and illustrate key features further.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
      I stumbled upon your website while I was researching for preparation materials, being a total newbie to IELTS.

It’s really helpful for me&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for this task&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I congratulate you for your page, which is one of the best that I have visited. Your lessons are very clear and simple to learn from. Also, watching you from your youtube videos, I see a perfect english teacher transmitting the information in the most effective way for us viewers (speaking personally). Actualy I am preparing for IELTS exam and your lessons of task 1 in Writing are the best I have ever seen, very easy to remember when I work on differents topic of this task.&lt;br&gt;
 Many thanks for this opportunity!&lt;br&gt;I’m pleased you found my website and can benefit from my lessons. Good luck with your test !! 🙂&lt;br&gt;Thank you sooooooooo much ♥️ for sharing this task and tips. I’m really glad to get these.&lt;br&gt;
I am Ruhi, from Bangladesh&lt;br&gt;If pie chart is given along with the table, then, do we have to write over view from both or from pie chart only?&lt;br&gt;The overview is for everything on the paper. If you have two charts, or one chart and one table, it all goes in the overview together.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;Can I use bracket to mention percentages?&lt;br&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;You can use brackets in Writing Task 1. However, be flexible with how you present information and don’t overuse them.&lt;br&gt;Thank you for all the good work Liz, this indeed has been very helpul for me.&lt;br&gt;I’m glad it’s useful 🙂&lt;br&gt;The table shows the proportion of consumer expenses in three categories in five countries in 2002. Looking from the overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the category of food, drinks, and tobacco was the most popular, and it was followed by clothing and footwear. In contrast, people spent the least expenditure on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;Among the five countries, Ireland and Turkey recorded the highest percentages in food, drinks, and tobacco section, at 28.91% and 32.14%, respectively. The proportion of expenditure of Turkish people was also the highest in leisure and education, at 4.35%. For the clothing and footwear category, a significant percentage of 9% of Italian people were consumers.&lt;br&gt;However, it can be seen that Sweden had the lowest percentages for food/drinks/tobacco and clothing/footwear sections, at just under 16% for the former and 5.40% for the latter. Meanwhile, the percentage of expenditure on leisure and education of Spanish consumers was just around 2%.&lt;br&gt;Hi!&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all the website, it’s REALLY awesome and indeed assists me with preparation for IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Maybe, you could help me out, for I’m a bit perplexed. In the sentence “A similar pattern could be observed for Turkey, who/which spent the highest percentage…” should “who” or “which” be used. Since, generally, they use “which” with countries and “who” when talking about people. In this situation, the sentence is about people who spend, although it is expressed by country.  So what is the correct option to use?&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance)&lt;br&gt;“Turkey” is not people, it is a country so you need “which”.&lt;br&gt;Hello liz.&lt;br&gt;I took the IELTS indicator last week. everything went like I planed before, however, in the writing section task 1, I was given a line chart. They only put 2 lines in this line chart and both were increasing.  I did not have much to write because they were not a lot of information. Which cause me to have 5 in writing. I’m taking the exam again and I am really scared that they would give me the same one . What can I do….&lt;br&gt;Do you want to recreate the line graph you got so I can write a model answer?&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for your valued material. I just have a question for you, referring to tables (or probably it applies to other types of charts). When we are given groups, such as age groups or food groups, that implies different variables in the same category, can I change it by numbers? For example, Instead of saying “food/drinks and tobacco, can I use the expression: first group? or the second group (clothing, footwear), depending on the place in the table?&lt;br&gt;Thank you! 🙂&lt;br&gt;You would only be able to refer to them that way if you had introduced them in order in the introduction paragraph. Even then, you should alternate your expressions.&lt;br&gt;Perfect! &lt;br&gt;Thank you for your help! 🙂&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I can not thank you enough. Thank you so much for your help&lt;br&gt;
By the way, I have one question.&lt;br&gt;
Why is it “consumer items?” I thought it was consumed items.&lt;br&gt;“consumed” means either used or eaten. “Consumer” is a customer who buys products. Go to a dictionary and take a look for more precise definitions.&lt;br&gt;Perfect. Thanks a lot!&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz! I am doing the IELTS general test, do I need to practice table and chart exercises on the writing tasks? &lt;br&gt;Or does it come up only in the academic version of the test?&lt;br&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;Can you see the RED MENU BAR at the top of the website? Go to “TEST INFO” and select “GT” from the drop down list. That page will explain it all for you. There are loads of pages of tips, lessons, advice, information on this site. Use the RED BAR to open the main pages which will give you access to the lessons etc.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
Loved this answer. I have a doubt if we write the overview as 2 nd para will that be counted as a summing up/conclusion. I heard that conclusion has extra points for writing. Please help.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks Sandra&lt;br&gt;The conclusion is essential for writing task 2. If you fail to write a conclusion for writing task 2, you will get a lower score for Task Response. Writing task 1 is not an essay, it is a report. An overview is required for task 1. It is more logical to give the key features before the smaller details in a report.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz!I really appreciate the organisation of this task it is clear and coherent.But one thing that confuses me ,why did you describe Sweden at your 2 body ,i mean sweden’s  data is not highest 🤔&lt;br&gt;You task is not only to present the highest. It is to highlight key features and that includes the lowest. In body paragraph 1, Sweden was the lowest. In body paragraph 2, Sweden was the lowest.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I really appreciate for your amazing posts. It helps me  A LOT!!!!&lt;br&gt;
By the way, I have a question, Some of the answers separate the overview paragraph and some don’t.&lt;br&gt;
Is either way correct?&lt;br&gt;Both ways are correct. I tend to put my overview in the same paragraph as the introduction for diagrams if the introduction is only a few words in length. Otherwise I keep it entirely separate.&lt;br&gt;liz you’re very smart teacher…&lt;br&gt;This report was just great! I really liked how the information was grouped and delivered.&lt;br&gt;
However, I have one question with respect to the report on this topic I wrote myself trying to make use of paragraphs in order to group the similarities.&lt;br&gt;
Can I use ” ” to refer to a certain category? (e.g. in terms of “foods, drinks and tobacco” and “leisure and education”, the Turkish spent the most on these.)&lt;br&gt;No, it is best not to use “”.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz,&lt;br&gt;Your contents regarding IELTS are really usefull and important. But I’ve a little doubt. You’ve recommended to use 2 paragraphs for the body and other 2 for the introduction and overview.&lt;br&gt;
     But my IELTS teacher taught me to use 3 paras(for body)  for the 3 columns in the table.&lt;br&gt;
    And 3 paras(for body) if there are 3 pie charts in the task.&lt;br&gt;
    And 3 paras(for body) if it is a line graph. (1 for starting year, 1 for ending year, 1 for the rest of the duration)&lt;br&gt;Could you please explain whether it is correct or wrong !&lt;br&gt;Paragraphing needs to be logical and that is certainly logical. But it also needs to be used to group information together and highlight similarities – your paragraph is more than just 3 charts = 3 body paragraphs. Start looking more at the information being presented and see if you can find trends or features that can be grouped together making paragraphing more effective rather than simplistic and obvious. Your teachers recommendation limits your score in Coherence and Cohesion – not a problem is you are not aiming for a high score.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz,&lt;br&gt;
ı really can’t find the words to tell you how grateful I am of your content. After taking the exam for the 5th time, ı finally managed to get a 7,5. my previous score was 7, by reading the model essays and suggestions ı got the sore that ı needed. thank you sooo sooo much. ı really don’t think that ı could have done this without your help. ı wish you an amazing life, my you be happy just like you make others happy.&lt;br&gt;Well done getting the score you needed 🙂 I’m so pleased my lessons were useful for you 🙂&lt;br&gt;Hello, Liz, I saw you just wrote “on the other hand” without mentioning “on the one hand” before, is that proper?&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for replying.&lt;br&gt;Sure. No problem. You can use “on the other hand” without using “on the one hand” – but not vice versa.&lt;br&gt;hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
i m extremely thankful to you for your guidance.&lt;br&gt;In the above example essay for table, the discussion about expenditure on clothing and footwear category is only about highest and lowest nation.&lt;br&gt;
Isn’t there a chance that the essay may marked down for the task achievement metric????&lt;br&gt;
Also for the education and leisure also the averaged percentage are used to represent the intermediate countries, so can we proceed in that manner without violating the task achievement rubric???&lt;br&gt;That is incorrect. The paragraph about clothing and footwear contained information about all categories. You forget to look at the final sentence of that paragraph: “The national spending in this area for the remaining countries averaged around 6.5%………..”. This is called grouping information together and is a vital skill for writing task 1.&lt;br&gt;Hello  Liz,&lt;br&gt;Finding very easy to describe the table chart thanks for your help. I have a question ‘Is there any way we add end note at last?  Like overall table show the European consumer expenditure.&lt;br&gt;Be very careful of adding another statement which presents overall information. If you do that, it would mean that you have split the overview into two separate statements which exist, not together in one paragraph, but split into different parts of the report. This will lower your score for Coherence and Cohesion which is about logical organisation of information and paragraphs. Do you see what I mean?&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I noticed the tense you used  in your text is past tense, is this due to as the statement says 2012? What if the there is no specific dates given then  present tense would be the appropriate tense to  use correct?   I have seen other teachers use  present tense regardless of the year. Please advise. &lt;br&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br&gt;
Ahmed&lt;br&gt;Never ignore the dates given.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz. I really love your video. I want to ask you why my Australian teacher said I will lose score if I use “ illustrate” in task 1 except for diagrams. I learn how to write task 1 from your video and what he said today made me confused.&lt;br&gt;The word is fine to use. That is completely untrue. Your teacher is probably getting confused with the word “illustration” which means picture. The noun and the verb do not have 100% the same meaning.&lt;br&gt;Hi just wondering can i use ‘ The pie chart provided above gives information about….:is that correct in the report speech?&lt;br&gt;
Or that must to be only ‘ The pie chart illustrates the information/data….&lt;br&gt;You have written “above”/ But what is above the answer sheet? Nothing. You can’t use that word. Otherwise, it is fine.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I really like your website, you are doing amazing work.&lt;br&gt;Can I start to overview with ‘to sum up’ instead of overall? Besides, is there any problem with writing an overview in the last paragraph?&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;The examiner is specifically looking for an overview. It is the most important paragraph. Which linking device do you think is most suitable? You aren’t going to lose marks because you use “To sum up”, but it isn’t the most appropriate for an overview.",https://ieltsliz.com/ielts-table-band-9-model-answer/
ZAP,"Hi, dear Liz.&lt;br&gt;
I just wanted to know if the data was from the previous year, I assume, then why in the last sentence of the third paragraph it was not “… which was around that of Spain”, in place of “is”.&lt;br&gt;
Could please….&lt;br&gt;As you see from the information given in the rubric (that is the description given of the table, above the table” and the table, that the date is 2002. That is in the past.&lt;br&gt;the table illustrates the proportion of the national expenditure spent on consumers goods in Ireland, Italy,Spain,Sweden and Turkey in the year 2002.&lt;br&gt;
overall, a look across the table, shows that the in all of the five countries, most of their money was spent on food, drinks and tobacco. while the least amount went to leisure and Education. moreover, Turkey had the most percentage in two of the categories.&lt;br&gt;
in terms of consumables, Turkish and the  people of ireland spent 32.14% and 28.91 respectively emerging the first and second in&lt;br&gt;
position, while the exepenses for the remaining&lt;br&gt;
countries were under 20%. On the other hand,  the least spending were on leisure and education which was below 5% in all of the countries. however,  Turkey was still the highest with 4.35% as opposed to Spain who spent 1.98%.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, all of the countries spent less than 10% on clothing and footwear. However, Italy emerged the highest with 9.00% and Italy the lowest in this category with 5.40%.&lt;br&gt;The table illustrates the national expenditure on three different items in several countries (Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey) in 2002.&lt;br&gt;Overall, most of the countries spent the most money on food, drinks, and tobacco. In contrast, the least amount of spending in all countries was on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;In terms of food, drinks, and tobacco, Turkey showed the highest expenditure at about 32,14% compared to other countries. In contrast, Sweden spent the least money on this item which was only 15,77% of their total national expenditure. The outlay of the remaining countries ranged between 16,36% to 28,91%. On the other hand, Italian people’s spending on clothing and footwear was the highest (9,00%) compared to the remaining countries, while Sweden only spent around 5%.&lt;br&gt;
The expenditure on the last items, which were leisure and education, by Turkey reached around 4% as opposed to Spain which expended less than 2%. The outlay of Ireland, Italy, and Sweden was more than 2%.&lt;br&gt;The table illustrate five different countries on the expenditure on food /drink/tobacco, clothing/footwear and leisure/education in 2002.&lt;br&gt;Overall food/drink/tobacco has the most significant expenditure by consumer on all the five countries whereas less than five percentage were accounted for in all the spending among the countries on leisure/education&lt;br&gt;However Turkey been the most significant country with about 32.14%expenditure on food /drink/tobacco which has the highest consumer compare to Spain with 1.98%.Ireland ,Spain,Italy and Sweden are as follows with 28.9%,18.0%,16.36%,and 15.77% respectively.Leisure/education represent the least of all spending in 2002 with about less than 5%in all countries&lt;br&gt;In contrast to the other items clothing/footwear is triple that of leisure where Italy represent the most significant expenditure of about 9.00%.&lt;br&gt;The table illustrate the five countries (Ireland, Italy, spain, Sweden, turkey) consumer spending their money  on various kind of item in 2002.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, here we seen that in each country consumer spend large of their money in food / drinks/tobacco. While on the other hand, they spend amount portion on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;
Here, Ireland and turkey spend their big portion on food , drinks and tobacco which is 28.91% and 32.14% respectively. Others three country Italy , spain and Sweden spend also in this portion under 20%. But, mostly significantly seen that each country expenditure on leisure and education under 5% while the turkey is the highest 4.35%.&lt;br&gt;
Now on the other hand, clothing and  footwear each country spend on this portion under 10 % and Italy spending on this almost 9% which is one the highest in those five countries and the lowest percentage of this is seen that in sweden which is 5.40% respectively.&lt;br&gt;The table illustrates the percentages of the spending habits of people in three categories both in four European countries and Turkey in 2002.&lt;br&gt;Overall, consumers spent the highest proportion of their money on food/drinks/tobacco and then clothing/footwear. The percentages were higher in Turkey and Italy than other countries respectively, and the lowest rates were in Sweden. Furthermore, leisure/education was popular in Turkey and it was lower in Spain than other nations. &lt;br&gt;When the table is examined in detail, food/drinks/tobacco was higher in Turkey with 32.14% and it followed by Ireland by almost 3% difference. In the other European countries consumers spent 15.77% to 18.80% of their money on it.

Approximately 3% accounted for Italy and Sweden and they followed by Ireland and Spain with 2.21% and 1.98% respectively. &lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, could you please mark my answer.&lt;br&gt;The table shows how three categories of consumer goods were spent  in five countries percentagewise in the year of  2002.&lt;br&gt;Overall, spendings in food, drinks and tobacco made up the largest proportion followed by the category of clothing and footwear, while leisure and education expenses contributed the least.

Approximately, total percentage for the leisure and education costs in Sweden and Italy is 3.2% while only 1.98% of national expenditure were utilised in Spain’s leisures and educational sector.&lt;br&gt;The table depicts the information about the national expenditure in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Turkey on three types of consumer spending in the year 2002.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the category of the consumer goods that all countries spent the most was food, drinks and tobacco, which was three time higher than the other types. While, the lowest spending could be seen in leisure and education in all five countries.&lt;br&gt;evidently, it is clear from the table that Turkey and Ireland spent the most on food, drinks and tobacco that is 32.14% and 28.91% respectively.

After that clothing and footwear was the third category in which Italy spent the highest which is 9% and Sweden spent the lowest which is 5.40%. Turkey,  Ireland and Spain spent the almost same amount of expenditure on clothing and footwear items.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz and others,&lt;br&gt;
Is there someone else to rate my writing.&lt;br&gt;
    The table illustrates the proportion of  annual expenses of consumer spending in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Turkey in year of 2002.&lt;br&gt;
        In terms of leisure and educational expenses, Spain spent the lowest at 1.98%. The expenditure of Ireland also low compared to Turkey. Italy and Sweden spend 3.20% and 3.22% respectively.

    Clothing and footwear was the third category of consumer goods and outlay for those items were between 9% in Italy and 5.4% in Sweden. The national spending in this area for the remaining countries averaged around 6.5%.&lt;br&gt;
     Overall, all countries spent the most amount of money on food, drink and tobacco, which was a way higher than the other 2 categories of expenditure. The lowest could be seen in educational and leisure expenses category. The highlight of this chart is Turkey with generally higher numbers in all category of expenses than the other countries.&lt;br&gt;The table below depicts data about the expendature of goods of five countries in 2002.&lt;br&gt;
            Overall, it is clear that all the nations spent the most on food, drinks and tobacco however least on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;

The second most is spent by Ireland that is 28.91% which is greater than Italy and Spain that are 16.36% and 18.80% respectively.

Overall, there are three different segments of consumer spending have been listed-food, clothing and expenses related to leisure &amp; education.&lt;br&gt;
While the food and education expenses are found to be highest in Turkey, consumer spending for clothing is the most in Italy.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, though the consumer spending in food &amp; beverage and clothing is the lowest in Sweden, annual expenses regarding education and other leisure items are the least in Spain.&lt;br&gt;
Italy and Ireland are the two countries which accounted for the highest consumer spending on food including beverage and tobacco, 32.14% and 28.91% respectively. On the contrary, the consumer expenses in those items are found to be almost half of that percentage in other three countries, averagely around 17.00%.&lt;br&gt;
National spending on clothing was under 10.00%, where the spending in consumer clothing items in Italy is accounted for the most and the least in Sweden. The expenses people tend to make in this field is quite similar in all the countries; almost around 7.00%.&lt;br&gt;
The consumer spending in education and other free activities are quite lower compared to the annual consumer spending in food and clothing in the mentioned countries. Like the food expenses, the spending in leisure and education are also the highest in Turkey. The average spending of the other countries stands at less than 4.00%, while the spending in this sector is the lowest in Spain.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
It will my pleasure if you help me with my writing.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks in advance…&lt;br&gt;The table illustrates Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Turkey data on end users expenditure on various items in 2002.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it is clear that, the total national investment on food, drinks and tobacco was greater than clothing, footwear, leisure and education categories. Moreover, Turkey has the greatest on foods, leisure and education items while Italy had the most investment in clothing and footwear.&lt;br&gt;
In terms of food, drinks and tobacco consumption, Turkey national consumer expenditure was 32.14% which was greater than other four countries. Furthermore, Ireland had the second largest investment and it was 28.91%. The percentage of consumer expenditure for Spain and Sweden were 18.80 and 15.77 percent respectively. However, the expenditure of Italy was the least to that category and it was around half of Turkey’s expenditure.&lt;br&gt;
Although Italy had lowest consumer expenses in previously described category, it had the greatest 9% expenditure in clothing and footwear. For the consumer of Ireland, Spain and Turkey, the expenditure value ranges between 6 and 7 percent. However, Sweden had the least consumer expenditure on both clothing and food category with around 5.40%.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, in leisure and education category, the percentage of national investment was 4.35% which was greater than others in 2002. Both Italy and Sweden had minimal differences to the category and their costs were 3.20 and 3.22 percent respectively. Ireland had very little expenditure in educational and leisure category and just 1.98% was spent by Spain.&lt;br&gt;please reviw this and lemme know if i had mistaken somewhere?&lt;br&gt;the graph below shows the sales of children’s books, adult diction and educational books between 2002 and 2006 in one country.&lt;br&gt;
the given line graph depicts information about three different kinds of books being sold from 2002 to 2006 in a particular country. units are mentioned in million dollars.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it is conspicuously seen that there was an increase in trend in both children’s and educational books throughout the given period while sales of adult fiction decreased gradually.&lt;br&gt;According to the given graph, it is clear that in 2002, sales of children’s books stood at about 33 million dollars, but then it rise slightly to just over 40 million in 2003, and the figure went up significantly to about 55 million. similarly, from 2003 to 2003 the purchases of books in education surges dramatically to just over 30 million; this trend, however, experienced a slight decrease between 2003 and 2005, but then grew to more or less 33 million.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, a substantial increase had been seen in the sales of adult fiction from the commencing of the year till 2003 (which accounted for around 50 to 33 million dollars), before witnessing a sharp growth where it constituted precisely $ 40 million. Eventually, this trend again started to drop steadily by ($10 million) till the end of the given period.&lt;br&gt;the table depicts information about different items where people mostly spend their money in five countries in 2002. &lt;br&gt;overall, a greater portion of people consumed money for food items. Next, wearing items and a few of them are for free time and gathering knowledge. &lt;br&gt;In turkey and Ireland higher parcent of folk spend  for food items like drinks and tobacco which is 32. 14% and 28.91 % respectively in 2002. at the same period in Italy and Sweden’s people consumtion are lower like 16.36% and 15.77% gradually. though Spain’s people consumed half percent of turkey consumption on food items &lt;br&gt;about clothing and footwear items the information shows that Italian sonsumer were spending 9.00% on the other hand Ireland,  Spain and Turkey Consumers  had been spending 6.43%, 6.51 % and 6.63% respectively whivh is almost same portion while almost 4.00% less Sweden consumer were spending for this items than Italy.&lt;br&gt;

That was an excellent sample essay! I had a doubt :&lt;br&gt;“Consumers of Italy, Spain, and Sweden spent around 15-20% in this category.”&lt;br&gt;Could I write something like this?&lt;br&gt;“Consumers in Italy …” would be correct.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I joined your youtube channel 2 ago.&lt;br&gt;
I noticed that you do not continue your youtube channel, Please, continue to put new videos,&lt;br&gt;
I will wait you…&lt;br&gt;As soon as my health allows me to make videos without risking serious consequences, I’ll start again.&lt;br&gt;Recover soon dear.&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;the table illustrate the percentage of how much consumers spent on certain consuming goods and services in 5 countries (Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and turkey) through the year of 2002.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the five countries spent the most amount of money on food, drinks and tobacco comparing to other consuming goods with Turkey in the lead, spending less on clothing and footwear and under 5% on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;With regards to tobacco consumption, Turkey, Ireland and Spain were the three leading countries with 32.14%, 28.91% and 18.80% respectively, while Italy (16.36%) and Sweden (15.77%) spend less comparing to other countries. &lt;br&gt;In terms of clothing and footwear, a 9% was spend in Italy slight above of what Ireland (6.43%), Spain (6.51%), Sweden (5.40%) and Turkey (6.63%) spent on the same items. Furthermore, all of the studied countries spent a marginal proportion of their money in the same year on services  (leisure and education).&lt;br&gt;The data given illustrates about the consumer spending on various items in 5 countries namely Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey. The expenses are broadly categorized into 3 parts: food/drinks/tobacco, clothing/footwear, and leisure/education. Turkey heads the country with the highest percent of spending in the food/drinks/tobacco column being 32.14%. Trailing Turkey is the country of Ireland with 28.91% of its expenses being in the food department as well. Italy is the country with the least percent of amount being spent on food/drinks/tobacco being 16.36%. Lagging behind in the food parameter, Italy tops all the 5 countries in clothing and footwear aspect that being 9%. Sweden is the country with the minimum amount of spendings of 5.4% in the clothing arena. Sweden though does spend a fair amount on education with 3.22% of its consumer spending, coming second when compared with a fair rate of 4.35% of Turkey. Spain remains almost average in the clothing and food sector but comes last in the percent spent on leisure and education with a low percent of 1.98.&lt;br&gt;Thanks so much for your patient teaching, Miss Liz. &lt;br&gt;The table given sheds light on information related to proportion of consumer expenditure on various items in five different countries (Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Turkey) in year 2002. Units are measured in percentage. &lt;br&gt;Overall, the share of food, drinks and tobacco was the largest among three categories with an average of 22.4% when leisure and education was the least at 2.99%, following a proportion of clothing and footwear (6.79%). &lt;br&gt;When it comes to a nation with the largest consumption on food, drink and tobacco, the first rank was Turkey which was close to Ireland (28.91%), but far different from the other three countries with below 20% percentage – Italy, Spain as well as Sweden. Likewise, Turkey was also the highest spending nation in a category of Leisure and Education with a number of 4.35%, but the remaining countries were much lower in their sharing percentage. &lt;br&gt;In terms of clothing and footwear, 9% of the distribution by Italy was the most outstanding amount. Comparatively, the other 4 countries are all below 7%. Sweden was the lowest percentage in this category which was at 5.4% merely.&lt;br&gt;The table depicts the proportion of expenditure in five different countries (Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Spain and Turkey) on three items in 2002.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it is clearly shown that all these countries spent the most on food/ drinks/ tobacco. Whereas, leisure/ education was the item with least expenditure across these countries.&lt;br&gt;Generally, Turkey recorded the highest in spending for food/drinks/tobacco at 32.14%, swiftly followed by Ireland with 28.91%. Further, there was only a slight gap between Italy, Spain and Sweden that accounted for about 2-3% differences. Surprisingly, Italy dominated all other countries as they spent the highest in clothing/ footwear at 9%, while the rest spent roughly 3-4% lower.&lt;br&gt;It is also worth noting that in terms of leisure/ education, it was still the Turkish who ruled the highest at 4.35%, in contrast to Spanish which was over 2% less. Expenditure differences on this item were marginally insignificant among other three countries.&lt;br&gt;Mam, you are an amazing teacher. what is your health condition now? please, get well soon. Lots of love.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for asking. I’m still sick unfortunately, but I do feel a bit stronger this year than the previous few years. Hopefully this is a good thing. I’ll see how I am later this year. I’ll make a video with an update of my personal situation soon so you all know.&lt;br&gt;Godspeed recovery. Sending warm hugs and snuggles to you our fighter ❤️&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;Hey Liz! Can we use “i.e” to list data in intro?? Btw you’re an amazing teacher! Lots of  love..&lt;br&gt;No, you should not use “ie”. You are not presenting examples of data, you are presenting data. Just give the stats directly.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, your explanation is very useful for everyone. Thank you ❤️&lt;br&gt;Please rate my writing:&lt;br&gt;The given table illustrates the data of three kinds of consumers, who spent their money on mentioned products in five different countries during 2002.&lt;br&gt;First of all, people from Turkey spent the most on food, drinks and tobacco which is 32.14%, while Italians were the least to spend on that area(16.36%). In the clothing and footwear section, they were also at the top position by contributing  9% whereas Sweden was operating at the lowest rate, 5.40%. Spain’s budget for leisure and education was 1.98% but Turkey spent 4.35% of their money in that area.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, people from Ireland spent 28.91%, 6.43%, and 2.21% respectively for mentioned items in the table. However, Sweden almost spent three times more on food and drinks than on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it’s pretty clear that consumers from all five countries were more interested in food, drinks, and tobacco as they have spent the hugely as against the rest of the items. However, Turkey spent the most combining all three departments.&lt;br&gt;The table illustrates the diferent percentatges of consumer spendings five diferent countries had on various items in 2002. Overall, all five countries had the higest expenditure in the category of food, drinks and tobacco which was between 15 and 28% and the least expenditure in leisure and education which was under 5%. Also, while Turkey was the country with more expenses in all items, Spain and Sweden were the lowest expenders.&lt;br&gt;
On the one hand the higher expenders in food, drinks and tobaco were turkey with the higest percentatge of 32.14% followed by Ireland with a 28.91%. Also, in both clothing/footwear and leisure/education Italy and Turkey were in general the countries which consumed more.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, the lowest expenders in food/drinks/tobaco were Sweden with a 15.77% followed by Italy with a 16.36%. Moreover, in clothing/footwear the lowest expender was Sweden with a 5.40% and in Leisure/education was clearly Spain with the lowest percentatge of  1,98%. n&lt;br&gt;The table illustrates proportion of national expenditure&lt;br&gt;
( Ireland,Italy,Spain,Sweden,Turkey) on three different consumer types in 2002.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, all countries spent more on  food/Drinks/Tobaco  Which was around three times higher than other goods.on the other hand education was least amount spent all countries. The outlay of Turkey was generally higher than the other four countries.&lt;br&gt;
In terms of food  Turkey spent most at  34%.while ireland expendiure  also high compared to Sweden.Spain and Italy spent at 16%&amp;18&amp; respectively.On the otherhand lowest expenditure was on all leisure/education which accounts for  all countries. Turkey spent most on this at 4.5% and which is double of spain expenditure on this goods.&lt;br&gt;
Clothing/Footwear is third consumer good total outlay for  those items were inbetween 5% &amp; 9%. Remaining Nations spent around average of 6 % on this  items.&lt;br&gt;The table provides data on expenditure by five different countries on three consumer items for the year 2002.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, It is apparent that all these nations spent the highest on the category named food, drinks, and tobacco. On the contrary, category clothing and Footwear, and category food and drinks occupied the second and third position respectively.&lt;br&gt;
In the category food, drinks, and tobacco, among five countries, Turkey(32.14%)spent more money than any other country did. On the other hand, the next country behind Turkey was Ireland(28.91%), followed by Spain(18.80%), Italy(16.36%) and finally Sweden(15.77 %). Even though clothing and footwear was the second-highest, there is a significant reduction in expenses by each of these five countries. The expenditures by Ireland,Italy,Spain, Sweden and Turkey are 6.43 %,9.00%,6.51%,5.4%,&amp; 6.63% respectively .&lt;br&gt;
Furthermore, these five nations individually spent less than 5% on leisure and education. Spain(1.98%) contributed the lowest for this category, while Turkey gave 4.35% of its share.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;Hello, Liz. Thanks for all these useful preparation materials. My question is, as I study academic writing task 1, I sometimes come across model answers with only one body paragraph, especially for questions that include tables. Is it okay to have only one body paragraph, or should we necessarily write a second one all the time?&lt;br&gt;The body must always be divided in to two or three paragraphs. This is part of how you distinguish categories and illustrate key features further.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
      I stumbled upon your website while I was researching for preparation materials, being a total newbie to IELTS. The contents of your website gave me a holistic and comprehensive idea on what I should expect, what is expected of me during the exam and how to tackle the same. I successfully achieved a band score of 8 in my IELTS, and I have you and your website to thank for that. I think you do splendid work enhancing the lives of aspirants like me. 🍻&lt;br&gt;Great score! Very well done 🙂&lt;br&gt;The table shows information about coustmor of five different nation ( Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and turkey) whose spend their income of three various item in 2002.

Overall, data reveals that people of all the nation spent big amount on food/drinks/tobacco. While least money were spending on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;
It is clear from the graph, Turkey spent the highest percentage of money on food and drinks while sweden spend minimum money on food. It was 32.14% and 15.77% respectively. Moreover, there was unnoticeable difference between Ireland and Turkey expenditure of clothing and footwear items. It was only 0.20 percentage.&lt;br&gt;
However, 1.98 % money spended by Spain on education and leisure particular. Whearas, Turkey expenses on this item was 4.35%. Nonetheless, italy more expenditure on clothes and footwear than other countries. Italy and Sweden spent same amount on education and leisure items.&lt;br&gt;The cited table gives us an insight into the fortune expended by the citizens of five European nations on three classified categories in the year 2002.&lt;br&gt;
	An overall glance of the given table suggests that the focus weighs towards the eatables and least interest is found on leisure or education. Turkey has recorded the majority of chunk being spent on food, drinks, or tobacco, while the Spanish show the least participation in spending money on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;
	Moreover, it is can be observed from the table that the citizens of Ireland, Italy and Spain show thrice willingness to spend on sartorial goods when compared to knowledge and entertainment. Furthermore, the majority of their income is contributed to consumable items ranging from 18.80% in Spain to Ireland with 28.91%, while Italians are found to be more trend-conscious and have spent 3% more on fashion.&lt;br&gt;
	In addition, the provided distribution table illustrates that Sweden is likely to spend half of the amount Turkish spends on food, drinks, and tobacco; however, Turkey enjoys a slight more lavish life than Sweden when it comes to the other two categories, contrasting with a difference of nearly 1.2%.&lt;br&gt;Greetings of peace Liz! If you have ample of time. Please do evaluate this one. Thank you so much!&lt;br&gt;The table chart shows the amount of money spent on five various countries namely Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey in terms of three different categories particularly food, drinks and tobacco, clothing and footwear, and leisure and education last 2002. Units are measured in terms of percentage.&lt;br&gt;Overall, Turkey had the highest money spent in food, drinks, and tobacco while Sweden had the lowest. In the latter country, it had the smallest utilization of money in clothing and footwear, whereas Italy had used their money much on it. Meanwhile, Turkey spent their money much on leisure and education than Spain, which had the minute spending on the aforementioned category. It is noticeable that Turkey is the leading country in spending money on food, drinks and tobacco, and leisure and education as well.&lt;br&gt;With regards to the food, drinks, and tobacco spending, Turkey had 32 per cent which is doubled than the amount of money spent by the Swedish people. Italy, on the other hand, had approximately 4 per cent larger than Sweden.&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Turkey had 4.35 per cent expenses on leisure and education while Spain had only 1.98 per cent.

It’s really helpful for me&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for this task&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I congratulate you for your page, which is one of the best that I have visited. Your lessons are very clear and simple to learn from. Also, watching you from your youtube videos, I see a perfect english teacher transmitting the information in the most effective way for us viewers (speaking personally). Actualy I am preparing for IELTS exam and your lessons of task 1 in Writing are the best I have ever seen, very easy to remember when I work on differents topic of this task.&lt;br&gt;
 Many thanks for this opportunity!&lt;br&gt;I’m pleased you found my website and can benefit from my lessons. Good luck with your test !! 🙂&lt;br&gt;Thank you sooooooooo much ♥️ for sharing this task and tips. I’m really glad to get these.&lt;br&gt;
I am Ruhi, from Bangladesh&lt;br&gt;If pie chart is given along with the table, then, do we have to write over view from both or from pie chart only?&lt;br&gt;The overview is for everything on the paper. If you have two charts, or one chart and one table, it all goes in the overview together.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;Can I use bracket to mention percentages?&lt;br&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;You can use brackets in Writing Task 1. However, be flexible with how you present information and don’t overuse them.&lt;br&gt;Thank you for all the good work Liz, this indeed has been very helpul for me.&lt;br&gt;I’m glad it’s useful 🙂&lt;br&gt;The table shows the proportion of consumer expenses in three categories in five countries in 2002. Looking from the overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the category of food, drinks, and tobacco was the most popular, and it was followed by clothing and footwear. In contrast, people spent the least expenditure on leisure and education.&lt;br&gt;Among the five countries, Ireland and Turkey recorded the highest percentages in food, drinks, and tobacco section, at 28.91% and 32.14%, respectively. The proportion of expenditure of Turkish people was also the highest in leisure and education, at 4.35%. For the clothing and footwear category, a significant percentage of 9% of Italian people were consumers.&lt;br&gt;However, it can be seen that Sweden had the lowest percentages for food/drinks/tobacco and clothing/footwear sections, at just under 16% for the former and 5.40% for the latter. Meanwhile, the percentage of expenditure on leisure and education of Spanish consumers was just around 2%.&lt;br&gt;Hi!&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all the website, it’s REALLY awesome and indeed assists me with preparation for IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Maybe, you could help me out, for I’m a bit perplexed. In the sentence “A similar pattern could be observed for Turkey, who/which spent the highest percentage…” should “who” or “which” be used. Since, generally, they use “which” with countries and “who” when talking about people. In this situation, the sentence is about people who spend, although it is expressed by country.  So what is the correct option to use?&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance)&lt;br&gt;“Turkey” is not people, it is a country so you need “which”.&lt;br&gt;Hello liz.&lt;br&gt;I took the IELTS indicator last week. everything went like I planed before, however, in the writing section task 1, I was given a line chart. They only put 2 lines in this line chart and both were increasing.  I did not have much to write because they were not a lot of information. Which cause me to have 5 in writing. I’m taking the exam again and I am really scared that they would give me the same one . What can I do….&lt;br&gt;Do you want to recreate the line graph you got so I can write a model answer?&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz!&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for your valued material. I just have a question for you, referring to tables (or probably it applies to other types of charts). When we are given groups, such as age groups or food groups, that implies different variables in the same category, can I change it by numbers? For example, Instead of saying “food/drinks and tobacco, can I use the expression: first group? or the second group (clothing, footwear), depending on the place in the table?&lt;br&gt;Thank you! 🙂&lt;br&gt;You would only be able to refer to them that way if you had introduced them in order in the introduction paragraph. Even then, you should alternate your expressions.&lt;br&gt;Perfect! &lt;br&gt;Thank you for your help! 🙂&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
I can not thank you enough. Thank you so much for your help&lt;br&gt;
By the way, I have one question.&lt;br&gt;
Why is it “consumer items?” I thought it was consumed items.&lt;br&gt;“consumed” means either used or eaten. “Consumer” is a customer who buys products. Go to a dictionary and take a look for more precise definitions.&lt;br&gt;Perfect. Thanks a lot!&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz! I am doing the IELTS general test, do I need to practice table and chart exercises on the writing tasks? &lt;br&gt;Or does it come up only in the academic version of the test?&lt;br&gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;Can you see the RED MENU BAR at the top of the website? Go to “TEST INFO” and select “GT” from the drop down list. That page will explain it all for you. There are loads of pages of tips, lessons, advice, information on this site. Use the RED BAR to open the main pages which will give you access to the lessons etc.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
Loved this answer. I have a doubt if we write the overview as 2 nd para will that be counted as a summing up/conclusion. I heard that conclusion has extra points for writing. Please help.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks Sandra&lt;br&gt;The conclusion is essential for writing task 2. If you fail to write a conclusion for writing task 2, you will get a lower score for Task Response. Writing task 1 is not an essay, it is a report. An overview is required for task 1. It is more logical to give the key features before the smaller details in a report.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz!I really appreciate the organisation of this task it is clear and coherent.But one thing that confuses me ,why did you describe Sweden at your 2 body ,i mean sweden’s  data is not highest 🤔&lt;br&gt;You task is not only to present the highest. It is to highlight key features and that includes the lowest. In body paragraph 1, Sweden was the lowest. In body paragraph 2, Sweden was the lowest.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I really appreciate for your amazing posts. It helps me  A LOT!!!!&lt;br&gt;
By the way, I have a question, Some of the answers separate the overview paragraph and some don’t.&lt;br&gt;
Is either way correct?&lt;br&gt;Both ways are correct. I tend to put my overview in the same paragraph as the introduction for diagrams if the introduction is only a few words in length. Otherwise I keep it entirely separate.&lt;br&gt;liz you’re very smart teacher…&lt;br&gt;This report was just great! I really liked how the information was grouped and delivered.&lt;br&gt;
However, I have one question with respect to the report on this topic I wrote myself trying to make use of paragraphs in order to group the similarities.&lt;br&gt;
Can I use ” ” to refer to a certain category? (e.g. in terms of “foods, drinks and tobacco” and “leisure and education”, the Turkish spent the most on these.)&lt;br&gt;No, it is best not to use “”.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz,&lt;br&gt;Your contents regarding IELTS are really usefull and important. But I’ve a little doubt. You’ve recommended to use 2 paragraphs for the body and other 2 for the introduction and overview.&lt;br&gt;
     But my IELTS teacher taught me to use 3 paras(for body)  for the 3 columns in the table.&lt;br&gt;
    And 3 paras(for body) if there are 3 pie charts in the task.&lt;br&gt;
    And 3 paras(for body) if it is a line graph. (1 for starting year, 1 for ending year, 1 for the rest of the duration)&lt;br&gt;Could you please explain whether it is correct or wrong !&lt;br&gt;Paragraphing needs to be logical and that is certainly logical. But it also needs to be used to group information together and highlight similarities – your paragraph is more than just 3 charts = 3 body paragraphs. Start looking more at the information being presented and see if you can find trends or features that can be grouped together making paragraphing more effective rather than simplistic and obvious. Your teachers recommendation limits your score in Coherence and Cohesion – not a problem is you are not aiming for a high score.&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz,&lt;br&gt;
ı really can’t find the words to tell you how grateful I am of your content. After taking the exam for the 5th time, ı finally managed to get a 7,5. my previous score was 7, by reading the model essays and suggestions ı got the sore that ı needed. thank you sooo sooo much. ı really don’t think that ı could have done this without your help. ı wish you an amazing life, my you be happy just like you make others happy.&lt;br&gt;Well done getting the score you needed 🙂 I’m so pleased my lessons were useful for you 🙂&lt;br&gt;Hello, Liz, I saw you just wrote “on the other hand” without mentioning “on the one hand” before, is that proper?&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for replying.&lt;br&gt;Sure. No problem. You can use “on the other hand” without using “on the one hand” – but not vice versa.&lt;br&gt;hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
i m extremely thankful to you for your guidance.&lt;br&gt;In the above example essay for table, the discussion about expenditure on clothing and footwear category is only about highest and lowest nation.&lt;br&gt;
Isn’t there a chance that the essay may marked down for the task achievement metric????&lt;br&gt;
Also for the education and leisure also the averaged percentage are used to represent the intermediate countries, so can we proceed in that manner without violating the task achievement rubric???&lt;br&gt;That is incorrect. The paragraph about clothing and footwear contained information about all categories. You forget to look at the final sentence of that paragraph: “The national spending in this area for the remaining countries averaged around 6.5%………..”. This is called grouping information together and is a vital skill for writing task 1.&lt;br&gt;Hello  Liz,&lt;br&gt;Finding very easy to describe the table chart thanks for your help. I have a question ‘Is there any way we add end note at last?  Like overall table show the European consumer expenditure.&lt;br&gt;Be very careful of adding another statement which presents overall information. If you do that, it would mean that you have split the overview into two separate statements which exist, not together in one paragraph, but split into different parts of the report. This will lower your score for Coherence and Cohesion which is about logical organisation of information and paragraphs. Do you see what I mean?&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I noticed the tense you used  in your text is past tense, is this due to as the statement says 2012? What if the there is no specific dates given then  present tense would be the appropriate tense to  use correct?   I have seen other teachers use  present tense regardless of the year. Please advise. &lt;br&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br&gt;
Ahmed&lt;br&gt;Never ignore the dates given.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz. I really love your video. I want to ask you why my Australian teacher said I will lose score if I use “ illustrate” in task 1 except for diagrams. I learn how to write task 1 from your video and what he said today made me confused.&lt;br&gt;The word is fine to use. That is completely untrue. Your teacher is probably getting confused with the word “illustration” which means picture. The noun and the verb do not have 100% the same meaning.&lt;br&gt;Hi just wondering can i use ‘ The pie chart provided above gives information about….:is that correct in the report speech?&lt;br&gt;
Or that must to be only ‘ The pie chart illustrates the information/data….&lt;br&gt;You have written “above”/ But what is above the answer sheet? Nothing. You can’t use that word. Otherwise, it is fine.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, I really like your website, you are doing amazing work.&lt;br&gt;Can I start to overview with ‘to sum up’ instead of overall? Besides, is there any problem with writing an overview in the last paragraph?&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;The examiner is specifically looking for an overview. It is the most important paragraph. Which linking device do you think is most suitable? You aren’t going to lose marks because you use “To sum up”, but it isn’t the most appropriate for an overview.",https://ieltsliz.com/ielts-table-band-9-model-answer/?replytocom=2580383
