Miss Liz or any ILETS candidate. Please share your advice on my piece of writing on task 1, I would humbly appreciate it. Thank you!&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the proportion of visitors, who visited a specific Caribbean island over 7 years from 2010 and 2017. The numbers are measured in millions.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the total number of visitors fluctuated throughout the period given, while the number of visitors staying on cruise ships who started from the lowest number in the first year showed a minor decline after two years before going up to the second highest number. There was a steady growth in the number of visitors who stayed on cruise ships.&lt;br&gt;With regards to the figure of people staying on cruise ships, it began at around 0.3 millions of visitors in 2010 and grew steadily to 0.5 millions people after one before falling down to the same number in 2012, however throughout the coming years the number climbed considerably to the second highest of approximately 2 millions visitors in the final year. &lt;br&gt;Total number of visitors over the years went up marginally. It started with 1 million visitors which was the highest compared to other visitors, who reached at the highest peak of around 3.5 millions 7 years later. In contrast, the number of people staying on island accounted for an unstable increase, there were about 0.3 million of people who stayed on island in the first year, and this remained constant till 2012. The figure grew up slightly to a peak of 1.5 million visitors in 2015 before dropping to around 1.5 million in 2016 and grew again to the same number in the final year.&lt;br&gt;I don’t usually give feedback, but I will came a few comments:&lt;br&gt;
1) your introduction is very limited. There are only three lines in this line graph and you didn’t introduce them. You should be introducing the key information that helps the reader understand what the line graph is presenting. In this case, it is visitors to a Caribean island who stayed on cruise ships, those who stayed on the island itself and the total number of visitors overall.&lt;br&gt;
2) your overview statement contains inaccurate information. Nearly all lines in a line graph will fluctuate in some way – only a straight line doesn’t fluctuate. But in this graph, the fluctuation of the total number of visitors was insignificant. The key feature was that the total number of visitors increased considerably over the period given. Not being able to focus on key features for the overview will lower your score.&lt;br&gt;
3) Your overview gives information about the visitors who stayed on cruise ships, but nothing about those who stayed on the island. Why? The overview contains ALL key features. While both visitors on cruise ships and those on the island increased over the period, cruise ships were less popular at the start of the period compared with staying on the island, but this trend reversed by the end of period. You really need to practice spotting key features and report them clearly. You also need to know what to compare and what not to compare. You don’t compare the total number of visitors with visitors on a cruise ship. The total number of visitors is separate and doesn’t need comparing. But you can compare visitors who chose to stay on a cruise ship with those who chose to stay on the island. Most line graphs don’t have much comparisons, but you can put this one in the overview.&lt;br&gt;I won’t make more comments on the body paragraphs because you can see what you need to focus on. Usually, when someone writes a good overview, the body paragraphs follow a similar logic.&lt;br&gt;For anyone else wanting feedback, please note that I don’t provide a marking service or feedback service at present. Any writing you post on my website will not usually get feedback. So, when I do give feedback to someone, it is actually for the benefit of everyone who reads the comments. All the best, Liz&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,my name is Shamilah, iam from Kenya,I wish to start my IELTS academic from 13th this month,and I would wish to be part of your classes na training too,iam beginning my journey for the USA, kindly add me to your group for the beginners so that I can be able to learn, thank you so much.&lt;br&gt;When your English is at the level you want to get the band score you want, you will start learning about IELTS, practicing tests and materials, and developing skills. There is no such thing as a beginners IELTS course. IELTS is IELTS. This website contains over 300 pages of test information, practice lessons, tips, topics, model answers etc – all for free. It is your task to use these free resources to prepare for the test when you are confident in your level of English.&lt;br&gt;You are a great person&lt;br&gt;The line graph depicts the amount of consumption of three types of spreads over a period of 26 years, beginning from 1981. Units are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;
The amount of butter consumed was higher than another kind of spread till 1991. By 2007, the consumption of all of the spreads had reduced among the population.&lt;br&gt;
In 1981, almost 140 grams of butter was eaten compared to 90 grams of margarine. By 1991, the amount of butter and margarine consumed had become the same. However, after 1991, butter consumption saw a steady decline but margarine remained stable till 1996.&lt;br&gt;
The consumption of butter has seen a dramatic decline since 1981, reducing to about 50 grams in 2007. By contrast, the popularity of reduced and low fat spreads increased steeply, reaching a peak of about 80 grams in 2001. Margarine usage remained relatively stable throughout the given time period, seeing a sharp decline only after the year 2001.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz. I have a question about writing task one. Recently, I have seen some band nine sample answers from a particular site, and the have some strange words. Here is the whole sentence – “The line graph delineates the fluctuations in average monthly temperatures across three prominent cities: Paris, Dubai, and Sydney, over the course of a year, with the temperatures expressed in degrees Celsius.” Can I use the word “delineates” in WT1?&lt;br&gt;I can’t comment on other websites. Do you know the author? Did the author complete the IELTS examiner training? Are you happy with their teaching qualifications and general experience? Such language is used to impress the examiner according to some teachers. It doesn’t impress them. It is not about creative writing or fancy language. A report is a simple factual report on data given. Use the word “illustrates” or “shows” or “gives information about”. Always aim for accuracy and appropriacy, even up to band 9.&lt;br&gt;The chart illustrates the amount of three types of spreads (margarine, low fat &amp; reduced spreads, and butter) which were consumed from 1981 to 2007. Units are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the three spreads are on a downward trajectory. As of 2007, the consumption of all the spreads are below 80 grams. Initially, butter was the most popular spread consumed in 1981 and it remained as the top choice until 1991, when its consumption fell to 100gr, which was at the same level of consumption as margarine. From that point onwards, the popularity of margarine took over the butter market and the butter fell off.&lt;br&gt;Butter consumption started off strong at 140 gram in 1981 and then rose to its peak at 160gr in 1986 before sharply declined to 1991. Afterwards, butter consumption kept declining to about 50gr in 2007. Correspondingly, the consumption of margarine also started strong at 90gr in 1981 and slightly fluctuated after the first year before dropping to 40gr in the final year.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, the consumption of low fat and reduced spreads in its first year was only at 10gr. However,  the number skyrocketed to a little over 80gr in just 5 years but the consumption fell of to around 70gr in 2007.&lt;br&gt;I don’t usually make comments, but I will say – please be more careful with the overview. The overview is the most important part of your task 1 report. It does not contain any details of how much in different years. It contains only the main trends. Please read the model answer above as a guide, otherwise you will get a low score. Also check your use of vocabulary, we don’t use words such as “fell off” or “took over” or “started strong”. You can find useful vocabulary for line graphs on the main page for writing task 1 on this website.&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the fluctuation in the average prices of staple foods – bread, milk, cereal, chicken wings, and marmalade – in the UK over 25 years from 1993.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the prices of all staples increased during the given period. Cereal stood out as the most significant expense, experiencing a massive surge after a few fluctuations. In contrast, the initially lowest-priced staple, milk, witnessed numerous climbs and eventually secured a position among the top three highest.&lt;br&gt;The trend in cereal prices began at around $1.5, fluctuated with an uptrend reaching $2.3 in 1998, followed by a downtrend stabilizing at under $2. Subsequently, there was a dramatic climb to nearly $3 in 2018. Similarly, chicken wings, initially priced at approximately $1.2, underwent fluctuations before reaching almost $2.3 in the final year after the price of cereal.&lt;br&gt;Conversely, the initially lowest-priced staple, milk, started at $0.2 in 1993, gradually rose until 2003 then experienced fluctuations that surpassed the price of chicken wings in 2013, and dramatically increased to $2 in the final year. Bread’s price, starting at nearly $0.3, considerably rose to $1.2 in 2018. Marmalade’s price fluctuated from $0.5 in the first year to just $1 in the final year.&lt;br&gt;I would like to improve my clarity, cohesion, and consistency in expression. if possible, please help to review and give me some feedback for this line graph writing, thank you so much&lt;br&gt;Absolutely good essay&lt;br&gt;hi , of course it’s the most useful task 1 essay , I’ve ever read so far , Thank you so much Liz🤝&lt;br&gt;
much appreciated&lt;br&gt;The depicted graph elucidates the amount of intake of three different kinds of spreads (margarine, low fat, and reduced spread) that were consumed during 26 years from 1981 to 2007. The measuring unit is the gram.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the consumption of butter and margarine fell over the years, and the amount of low-fat and reduced spread rose. At the start, butter was the most consumable spread but was replaced by margarine from 1991 to 2001. Afterthat, low fat and reduced spread were widely used throughout the remaining period.&lt;br&gt;
 In 1981, the intake of butter was about 140 grams, and after a period of time around 5 years it rose to around 160 grams. Afterthat, it fell dramatically to around 70 grams in 1996. At last, it ended the journey in 2007 at about 50 grams. Whereas, the margarine consumption started at around 90 grams in 1981. While fluctuation it maintained the position until 2001. Afterthat, it holds a position below 40 grams at the end of the period given.&lt;br&gt;
Whereas, the low-fat and reduced-spread consumption started from the year 1996 and in just 4 years it holds the position above the remaining two spreads at around 85 grams. By maintaining its rank it ended the journey at around 70 grams in 2007.&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the amount of consumed margarine, low fat &amp; reduced spreads, and butter between 1981 and 2007 in grams.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the amount of butter and margarine showed a downward trend over the given period whilst low fat &amp; reduced spreads experienced an upward trend despite its late entrance to the market.&lt;br&gt;
When the line graph is examined in detail, the amount of consumed butter was just over 140 gr in 1981. In the following five years, it peaked at 160 gr and then significantly decreased by 100 gr. Subsequently, it slightly fell to 50 gr. A similar trend was seen including a fluctuation in margarine which was eaten at approximately 90 gr at the beginning then modestly declined to 80 gr and recovered quickly to 100 gr in a decade in which the butter had the same amount in 1991. Till 1996, the figure levelled off and then dropped gently to the same amount as in 1986. Afterwards, it was almost halved at the end of the given time frame.&lt;br&gt;
The use of low fat &amp; reduced spreads started in 1996 at almost 10 gr. It reached a peak of 80 gr in which margarine had the same amount in 2001. In the following five years, it gently dropped by approximately 10 gr. &lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, could you please mark my answer.&lt;br&gt;great 💯&lt;br&gt;The line graph indicates how the number of three spreads which was consumed over a 26-year period, starting in 1981.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it can be seen that three spreads consumed where Margarine and Butter reduced whereas Low fat &amp; reduced spreads escalated. Furthermore, consumption of Low fat &amp; reduced spreads was consistently higher over the period.&lt;br&gt;
Looking at the chart in more detail it is evident that the amount of butter was used, it began at around 140 Grams(gm) in 1981. By 2007, it had decreased to approximately 65 gm, which was the greatest drop of all the categories. Similarly, the consumption of Margarine was around 90 gm in 1981. After that it was slightly increased in 1991 and remained constant to 1996, it fell to around 40 gm in 2007, respectively.&lt;br&gt;
Turning to the remaining amount of consumption of low fat &amp; reduced spread in beginning almost it was 10 gm in 1996. This number climbed to 85 gm in 2001, which has taken only 5 years. However, in 2007 it reduced approximately 70 gm.&lt;br&gt;Very nice 👍&lt;br&gt;The above given line graph depicts the utilisation of margarine, low fat and reduced spreads and butter spreads between 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the consumption of margarine, low fat and reduced spreads and butter has declined throughout a twenty six years period. Utilisation of margarine over the years shows significant fluctuations while butter shows a general decline and low fat and reduced spread consumption shows a drastic increment with a steady downturn. During the beginning of the period consumption of butter had been the highest and utility of low fat and reduced spread was the lowest while in contrary during the end of the period low fat and reduced spread consumption had been consumed enormously out of all and margarine consumption had hit rock bottom.&lt;br&gt;In 1981 approximately 140 g of butter had been consumed which illustrates a gradual downward trend in the years 1986 to 1991 and the consumption load drops down to 100g. During the entire period from 1986 to 2007 the consumption of butter depicts a negative gradient showing a gradual drop in the utility reaching almost 40g of consumption amount by 2007. While on the other hand, the consumption of margarine in 1981 was almost 90g which dropped down to 80g during 1986. Then it attained a gradual resurgence to 100g surpassing the consumption amount of butter and reached a constant plateau from 1991 to 1996. Then the amount gradually dropped down in the next consecutive years and reached 40g by 2007.&lt;br&gt;While the consumption of margarine was less than 20g during 1996 and the amount skyrocketed making the utility congruent to the amount of margarine consumption during 2001 and eventually dropping down with a steady amount to approximately 60g by 2007.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much Liz. I have learned a lot on your website and I did well in my exam. Thanks again from the bottom of my heart.&lt;br&gt;Glad to hear you did well 🙂 Wishing you all the best for your future 🙂&lt;br&gt;thank you Liz.I have learned a lot on your website.&lt;br&gt;The information regarding the amount of three different spreads in terms of grams (margarine, low-fat and reduced-fat spreads, and butter) consumed between 1981 and 2007 is shown in the line graph.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it is clear that the consumption of low-fat and reduced-fat spreads and butter experienced both decline and rise, while margarine’s rate fluctuated over the period given. Interestingly, the number of consumers of margarine and low-fat and reduced-fat spreads was equal at the end of the final third of the whole time frame.&lt;br&gt;From 1981 to 1986, there was a rise of nearly 20 grams, from 140 to 160 grams, in butter consumption. Low-fat and reduced-fat spreads’ average usage, however, reached a peak of 85 grams in 2001. Although both numbers initially showed an upward trend, they then began to fall steadily.&lt;br&gt;Between 1981 and 1996, the quantity of margarine production faced many fluctuations. By 1996, its rate had dropped constantly from 85 to 40 grams. Margarine and “low-fat and reduced-fat spreads” were used equally in 2001 in terms of product consumption.&lt;br&gt;This line graph illustrates the amount of consumption of 3 spreads (margarine, low fat and reduced spreads and buffer) in 26 years from 1981 to 2007. The unit are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the consumption of margarine and buffer decreased over the period given, while for low fat and reduced spreads, it rose. The popular spread was butter between 1981 and 1991 ,and which was replaced by margarine until 2001, and followed by low fat and reduced spreads in the last year in 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Butter began at about 140 and rose slightly to reach a peak of approximately 160 in 1986, after which it fell dramatically at almost 50 in the end of the period. Likewise, margarine was about 90 in the first year and it experienced a fluctuation from 1986 to 2001 before declined steadily to exactly 40 in the last year.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, for the amounts of low fat and reduced spreads was started at almost 10 in 1996 and climbed sharply to just over 80 in 2001, after which it decreased to about 70 in the end of the period.&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the usage of three kinds of spreads(butter, low fat and reduced spread and margarine) from 1981 to 2007.The units are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the consumption of margarine and butter was reduced over the following period while for low fat and reduced spread it rose, before falling. Butter was increased upto 160g in 1960 and the decreased below 50 gram in the final year. The consumption of low fat and butter was very low, below 20 gram, in 1996 then increased upto 80 gram in 2001.&lt;br&gt;In the beginning, the consumption of butter was 140 gram then it gradually increased to 160 gram in 1986. After that it fell dramatically to 60 gram, between 1986 and 2001, and hit a low of 50 gram in 2007. With regards to the amount of low fat and reduced spreads, it’s consumption started from 10gram in 2001 then rose dramatically and reached above 81 gram in 2007 before fell down to 70 gram at the end of the period.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, the consumption of butter was started from 90 gram and decreased to 80 gram at the start of period. After that, it went up to 100 gram and then remain same until the year 1996 before hit the low of 40 gram in 2007.&lt;br&gt;The line graph below illustrates the amount of various spreads consumed (margarine, low fat and reduced spreads, butter) from 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it can be seen that there were considerable downwards trend in the consumption of both butter and margarine, with the exception of low fat and reduced spreads. It is also clear that Butter was the most common product in 1981, but in 2007 Low fat and reduced spreads registered the highest figure.&lt;br&gt;
Starting at about 140 grams units in 1981, the consumption of Butter gradually reached a peak of 160 grams in 1986, at which point this figure started to drop dramatically to only 50 grams. Likewise, the figure for margarine witnessed the same pattern in which their consumption rose from 1986 to 1996 before declining to just 40 grams at the end of the period.&lt;br&gt;
Moving on, in 1996, although the comsumption of Low fat and reduced spreads appered later than others 15 years and was the lowest point at that time; however, this figure shot up swiftly hitting a peak of over 80 grams and finally remained the highest amount comsumed in 2007.&lt;br&gt;The line chart illustrates the amount of three different types of spreads (margarine, lowfat &amp; reduced spreads and butter) that were consumed, over a period of three decades, from 1981 to 2007. Overall, it can be clearly seen that while the butter consumption began with a higher value rather than the two items, it hit a low by the end of the given period. Low fat &amp; reduced type did not appear in the consumption map till 1991.&lt;br&gt;
Butter consumption stood at slightly over 140 grames at the beginning of the period before rising gradually to reach a peak of almost 160 gms and then decreased steadily to reach its minimum value of about 50 gms in 2007. Whereas there was a major difference between margarine and butter consumption at the start of the given period, this difference decreased dramatically to become less than 20 gms in 2007. Margarine consumption fluctuated around 90 gms from 1981 till 2001 after it fell smoothly to approximately 70 gms in 2007.&lt;br&gt;
1991 witnessed the appearance of Low fat &amp; reduced spread type with a value of about 10 gms. This figure, which increased gradually to its peak of about 80 gms in 2001, experienced a slight decline to about 70 gms in the last year.&lt;br&gt;The line graph demonstrates how three kinds of spreads (margarine, low-fat &amp; reduced spreads and butter) were consumed between 1981 and 2007. Units are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the amount of consumed spread witnessed (experienced) a downward trend with a plunge in using margarine and butter than the others over the period given.&lt;br&gt;
At the beginning of the period, there was only two spreads including margarine and butter used, with the consumption of butter was roughly 140 grams which was almost 50 grams higher than margarine. From 1981 to 1996, while the consumption of butter increased steadily and then reached a peak of around 160 grams in 1986 before decreasing dramatically to around 70 grams in 1996, the amount of consumed margarine dipped between 1986 and 1991 and remained flat until 1996.&lt;br&gt;
From 1996 to 2007, the low-fat &amp; reduced spreads was used for the first time in the start of the period and then increased rapidly to hit a high of around 85 grams in 2001 before dropping to 40 grams in the final year. Likewise, both of the consumption of margarine and butter witnessed a downward trend in this period. There was a steady fall and followed by a sharp decrease in the consumption of margarine. Similarly, the butter declined modestly from around 70 grams in 1996 to about 50 grams in 2007. In addition to that, the low-fat became more popular at the end of period from 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;The line graph consumed three spreads (margarine, low fat&amp; reduced spreads, and butter) from 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the consumption of margarine and butter reduced in almost all years. In contrast, low fat and reduced spreads had the lowest amount in the whole chart, but it rapidly increased in six years. In the last years, we also saw some reduction in it.&lt;br&gt;
However, in the beginning, the butter had the highest ratio (up to 160 grams) in 1996. with time, we could see dramatical fall in the whole years. At the same time, margarine had fluctuated ratio in 1 decade. After that, it remained the same for six years and had fallen proportion in remained years.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, low-fat &amp;reduced spreads had the lowest amount in the graph but dramatically increased (1996 8 grams but reached 80grams in only six years). It also had slightly dropped 70 grams.      &lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the amount of consumption of three different types of spreads&lt;br&gt;
(margarine, lowfat and reduced spreads and butter) from the period between 1981 to 2007. Units are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the consumption of margarine and butter showed a downward trend over the whole period, while the lowfat and reduced spreads consumption rose dramatically from 1996 to 2007. At the early stage of the period, the butter spreads dominated, whereas the contribution for lowfat and reduced spreads peakeda t the end of the period. &lt;br&gt;The butter spreads showed a dramatic increase from 140 to 160 grams in 1986 and declined sharply to50 grams at last in 2007. Similarly, the margarine eaten by consumers fall to 40 grams in 2007 which fluctuated before 2001 that is started from the beginning at 90 grams. &lt;br&gt;However, The whole period of 26 years had shown a significant change for lowfat and reduced spreads from 1996 to 2007. The consumption rate of that stood at a peak above 80 grams which started from 10 grams and later declined to 70 grams in 2007. But the rate of consumption remained at the top among all three spreads at the end of the period.&lt;br&gt;The Graph illustrates the intake of different type of spreads (margarine, butter and low fat &amp; reduced spread) between the years 1981 to 2007. Units are measured in grams&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the butter and margarine consumption has drastically decreased over a period of time. Low-fat &amp; reduced spreads shows an upward trend in the years 1996 to 2001 and accounted to be the highest consumed spread in the year 2007. The spread consumption was reduced in 26 years.&lt;br&gt;
In the year 1981, butter was used by around 140% which rose to around 160 % in the year 1986 before falling to 50% in the last year. Whereas the margarine started around 90% and there was slight reduction in margarine consumption the year 1986 which eventually increased to 100% in the years 1991 to 1996 before showing downward trend and accounted to be least consumed spreads in the year 2007&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, Low fat &amp; reduced spreads came into the picture in the year 1996 with 10% which drastically kept growing to 80% in the year 2001 and 75% use low fat &amp; reduced spreads in the year 2007.&lt;br&gt;The below graphs illustrate the expenditure of Margarine, Low fat &amp; reduced spreads and Butter into different six years (1981 to 2007).&lt;br&gt;
Overal, most of people spent Butter which is increased from up to 160 gr at he other hand Margarine drawdown into 80 gr while the people firstly never use Low fat&amp; reduced spreads till to 1990.&lt;br&gt;
From the green graph inferred spending Butter after peak point drastically declined less then 60 gr in 2007 and also the blue graph shown , the people started eating  Margarine in 1981 and a little bit decreased to 80 gr and contrast to increase up to 100 gr and steable to 1996.&lt;br&gt;
When the people consuming Low fat &amp; reduced spread using margarine declined and raised using butter at the peak of 82 gr&lt;br&gt;The line graph sheds light on the consumption trend of 3 spreads categories (margarine in blue line, low fat &amp; reduced spreads in red line, butter in green line) from year 1981 to year2007. Unit is measured in grams. &lt;br&gt;Overall, butter had the most total consumption over these 26 years which kept a higher consumption amount until margarine, its substitute, reached the same consumption level. Comparatively, low fat and reduced spreads appeared with its dramatic increase among 3 categories in spite of an inched downward afterward. &lt;br&gt;In 1986, the consumption on butter (160gram) is twice higher than margarine (80grams). However, the situation had changed since 1991. Although margarine made a platform from 1991 to 1996 by having the same number at 100grams, the difference between these 2 items was bigger and bigger. &lt;br&gt;In 1996, low fat and reduced spreads started being consumed and made a dramatic increase from less than 20grams to 80grams. Indeed, it is a critical year for margarine which was the main category from 1991 to 2001, but dropped further to 40grams, the least number in 2007.&lt;br&gt;The graph shows the consumption of Margarine, low fat and reduced spreads and butter during the years 1981 to 2007 showing different behaviors, units are measured in Grams.&lt;br&gt;Overall, Butter and low fat and reduced spreads had the bigger changes during these years from these 3 spreads, butter dropped from 160 grams in 1986 to about 45 grams in 2007 and fat increased the consumption from 1996 with 10 grams approximately to about 82 grams in 2001. However, this behavior was different from that year since it started to reduced gradually.&lt;br&gt;
In terms of Margarine, the ingest of this spread has been affected by fluctuation, this conduct is different from the other products. Initially, from 1981 to 1986 it is reduced, and then, in 1991 it was increased until 100 grams, this behavior continued to 1996 when began to drop to 2001 and from this point, the same conduct is showed until 2007.&lt;br&gt;The line chart illustrates the changes in using 3 types of fats between 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;
As we can see, there are not any tracks of low fat &amp; reduced spreads up to 1996 and that time it stood at around 10 grams but significantly increased and reached a peak of more than 80 grams in 2001. It was confronted to slight decline and reached to 70 grams approximately.&lt;br&gt;
Butter was most favorite fat in 1981. The rate of popularity was just more than 140 grams and continued climbing at the end of 1986. It was sharply slipped back to 70 grams stage between 1986 and 1996. Eventually, the consumption of butter plunged to less than 60 grams during 11 years from 1996 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Margarine was started from 90 grams in 1981 but plummeted to 80 grams just in 5 years. The next round was the opposite and this fat could rocket to 100 grams in the next 5 years. It leveled off at this score between 1991 and 1996. From 1996 a smooth falling was started and it came back to just more than 80 grams in 2001. Margarine was dramatically declined to 40 grams in 6 years from 2001 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;The graph illustrates the usage pattern of three types of spreads for a period of 26 years from 1981 to 2007. The units are shown in gms.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the consumption of butter decreased given time while that of fat &amp; reduced spreads followed the opposite trend.&lt;br&gt;The line graph Describes the consumption of 3 spreads between 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;Overall, the diagram shows that consumption rates of Butter and Margaring experienced a decrease through out the time period. However,&lt;br&gt;
The consumption rates of Low fat &amp; reduced Spreads experienced growth and Steadiness. All 3 spreads experienced many fluctuions.&lt;br&gt;In 1981 the consumption rate of Butter was about 140 grams. In one year, it rose to approximately 160 grams. After that, it decline subceeding margarine in 1991 and  low fat &amp; reduced Spreads in 2001 and reached to about 50 grams in 2007. The consumption rate of M was about 70 grams in 1981, it experienced a fall in 1985 which was about 80 grams. It experienced a growth of 20grams in 1991 exceeding the consumption rate of butter. It was steady till 1996 and after that, it declined subceeding   low fat &amp; spread n 2001. At the end of the period, it was about 4 grams, lowest among the all three. &lt;br&gt;The consumption rate of low-fat and reduced spreads was out 15 grams in 1996. It rocketed in 2001 approximately 81 grams exceeding both Butter and M. It experienced a slight downtrend till 2007 and at the end of the period, the consumption rates of low fat and Spreading was about 70 grams, which was highest amongst the other rates.&lt;br&gt;Note : Please let me know if there are any Modifications.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates how three different spreads were consumed by consumers from 1981 to 2007. Units are in grams&lt;br&gt;
Overall Butter and Margarine were initially eaten by the public but as the time elapsed, they lost their worth and new substitute known by the name low fat and reduced spreads has taken over their places&lt;br&gt;
In 1981 Butter was having a consumption rate of 140 grams which reach its peak to 160 grams in 1986, then it fell drastically to a level of 50 grams in 2007. While on the other hand Margarine was eaten around 90 g at the start, fluctuations in its usage were regularly there, but then it fell significantly to 40 g at the end of the period&lt;br&gt;
Low fat and reduced spreads their usage by residents began from 1996 at 10 g, then escalated to its highest point 80 g in 2001. Then in 2007 it shown a slight drop in its consumption level 50 g&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the amount of three types of spreads (margarine, butter, and low fat and reduced spreads) consumed by people within 27 years from 1981 to 2007 measured in grams. Overall, Butter once was the most consumed spread but fell drastically over years while low-fat spreads became the most popular spread in the last year.&lt;br&gt;In terms of butter, the consumption rate started from about 140 grams in 1981 and peaked at nearly 160 grams in 1986, but dropped drastically over years until around 50 grams in the last year. Margarine was consumed around 90 grams in the initial year, fell and rose in slight numbers over periods, but eventually fell to 40 grams in 2007.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, low fat and reduced spreads were first introduced in 1996 with the consumption rate was only below 20 grams. Then it became popular in the next five years where it rose dramatically to about 80 grams. However, in the latest year, people consumed less of this type of spread by around 70 grams.&lt;br&gt;Hello Liz, needed to confirm little something –&lt;br&gt;This was my try at writing the body 1 paragraph: &lt;br&gt;In 1981, butter consumed was slightly over 140g, while margarine was only approximately around 90g. The amount of consumption of butter rose to its peak nearly in the middle of the year 1986, which was almost 160g, the highest ever hit by any spread during the complete period. However, from there, there was only constant fall in its consumption. Margarine on the other hand, had quiet stability in its trend of consumption, since it only varied between 40g to 100g, also because it hit a plateau at 100g for considerably long period of time from around beginning of 1991 to near end of 1996.&lt;br&gt;I used Grammarly, it showed me many suggestions on missing “a” and “the”. No matter how much I try, I tend to skip them and it seems completely normal to me.&lt;br&gt;Do you think my marks will be deducted for the missing articles based on the paragraph I shared above? Are there not sufficient articles in it? Please let me know if possible! Thanks very much for your website, Liz 🙂&lt;br&gt;PLEASE EVALUATE. Many thanks in advance.&lt;br&gt;
The graph shows the usage of three different kinds of spreads (Margarine, butter, low fat and saturated spreads) over the span of 26 years from 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the usage of margarine and butter reduced over the period of time as compared to low fat and reduced spread, whose consumption increased.&lt;br&gt;
At the starting year, butter being the widely used spread its consumption rose from  about 140 grams to just below 160 grams in the time of five years (1981 to 1986) after that it dips to around 50 grams in the final year. Likewise, margarine was the second most used spread after butter, its usage was approximately 90 grams in the first year thereafter the figure fluctuated a little and then finally get down to 40 grams in the last year.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, low fat and reduced spreads even being the latecomer in the market but its consumption rose considerably from approximately 10 grams in 1996 to just above 80 grams in 2001  after drops slightly about 70 grams at the end of the period.&lt;br&gt;If there is anyone who can check and tell me where I stand by reading graph’s discription. I would be thankful.&lt;br&gt;The given line graph illustrates the utilisation three kinds of spreads (Matgarine, Low fat reduced spreads and butter) over the period of 26 years(1981 to 2007). The units are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be seen that the consumption of low fat and reduced spreads saw upward trend in last year while butter and margarine had reverse pattern during the same time. Initially, butter was consumed at the highest rate but later this was overcome by low fat and reduced spreads.&lt;br&gt;At the start of the period, the butter was used abundantly that was recorded nearly 140 grams which was peeked to around 160 grams and then dramatically reduced to approximately 50 grams in 2007. Similarly, between 1981 and 2007 Margrine’s consumption fluctuated between 90 grams to 40 grams.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, low fat and reduced spreads started consuming during the period about 1996, although it was consumed in  negligible amount that means near about 10 grams that quantity rose drastically and reached to 90 grams approximately and thereafter  there was a little drop in 2007 but the consumption was still the highest (around 70 grams) that was noticed as the largest utilisation among the three.&lt;br&gt;The given line graph illustrates the information about the amount of three different kinds of spreads (Margarine, Low fat &amp; reduced spreads, Butter) which were consumed between 1981 and 2007. Units are measured in grams.&lt;br&gt;Overall, it can be seen that the consumption of Butter and Low fat &amp; reduced spreads saw an upward trend, while that of Margarine had a reverse pattern. It is noticeably that The largest consumption was on Butter in 1981, but in 2007 Low fat &amp; reduced spreads’ consumption was most preferred.&lt;br&gt;Butter ranked first among the 3 surveyed kinds of spreads in the first year of the period. In the year 1986, the number of Butter consumed reached the highest point of around 160 grams. Thereafter, it dipped dramatically and hit the lowest point of about 50 grams in the final year.&lt;br&gt;In 1981, Margarine was the second most spread with around 90 grams. Over 5 years later, there was a gradual decline in the amount of Margarine by 10 grams. However, It increased moderately at 100 grams and leveled off until 1996. After that, the figure of Margarine fell considerably and hit a low of 40 grams in 2007. About Low fat &amp; reduced spreads’ data, starting nearly 10 grams in 1996, it went up rapidly and caught up with Margarine in 2001. After this, there was a minimal decrease in the amount of Low fat &amp; reduced spreads, yet, it was the most well-noted in the final year.&lt;br&gt;The line graph depicts a change in consumption of three spreads, Margarine, Butter, and Low fat and reduced spreads. The comparison is over the course of 26 years, from 1981 to 2007. At first glance, it is observed that the consumption of butter and margarine declined over the period, whereas low fat and reduced spreads had increased consumption during the time frame.&lt;br&gt;
Consumption of utter was the highest in the year 1981, which is slightly above 140grams, it then went on to peak at 160grams  in the next five years before plummeting to 50grams at the end of the period. In 1981, Margarine was consumed at 90grams and by 1996 it overtook butter as the most popular spread consumed. Eventually, Margarine ended as the least popular spread at about 40grams in 2007. Low fat and reduced spreads were first consumed in 1996, starting at 10grams and rapidly increasing above 80grams falling slightly down to 70grams in the final year.&lt;br&gt;
In summary, the consumption of low fat and reduced spreads instantly became a popular choice among the other two spreads. Whereas, Butter and Margarine consumption decreased over the period.&lt;br&gt;The linear graph showcases the amount of margarine,butter and low fat and reduced spread consumed in grams between1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;By and large, while the butter and margarine showed erratic patterns on their demands over the years surveyed, the free-fat and reduced spreads were dramatically increasing in the span of 11 years.&lt;br&gt;There were multifolds of notable changes on the demand of margarine and butter , one of this was, while the use of margarine sharply inclined by 20 grams the consumption of butter recorded slightly dip from 90grams to 80 grams. Another recognizable changes was the butter made a tremendous slumped that reached well within 60%, leveling off with margarine on 1991. On the other hand, while margarine stabilized at 100grams for half decade,the butter experienced further drop to 70grams . For 11 years left, both demands forementioned above recorded their lowest how much which reached 40 grams .&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile,although free-fat and reduced spreads started it popularity on 1996, the inflated demand of its skyrocketed by 8 folds and slightly reduced by 10 grams as the year ends.&lt;br&gt;Can someone read my answer and score it. Thanks in advance. Need a reference of where I am standing right now for giving IELTS. &lt;br&gt;The given graph illustrates three different type of spreads (margarine, Lowfat and reduced spreads, and butter) consumed in years 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the use of margarine and butter spreads decreased between the above mentioned years while the consumption of Lowfat &amp; reduced spread increased placing it in the first place in the year 2007, although people started to use this type up until the year 1996.&lt;br&gt;
Initially, the consumption of butter started from just above 140 grams in the year 1981, increasing this count to just below 160 in 1986, after this, the number started to decrease over the period until 2007, where it ended up at around 50 grams. Around 85 grams of butter spread was consumed in the year 1981 which varied significantly over the period and ended up 40 grams for the year 2007.&lt;br&gt;
The lowfat and reduced spread was not introduced up until the year1996 when the consumption was marked at around 10 grams from here the number started to increase drastically ending the record at around 65 grams in the year 2007.&lt;br&gt;Hi harshit, &lt;br&gt;Score 7&lt;br&gt;Comments:&lt;br&gt;
1. Low fat are two separate words&lt;br&gt;
2. At one place you wrote (, and) whereas in the other you didn’t. (, and is the right way to address it)&lt;br&gt;
3. Between the above isn’t the right sentence; rephrase it&lt;br&gt;
4. In the paragraph that starts with initially, you don’t have to emphasize too much on years&lt;br&gt;
5. Do not repeat the words in a sentence (eg: just above, just below)&lt;br&gt;
6. No comma after “after this”&lt;br&gt;
7. Space needed in the last paragraph between year and 1996&lt;br&gt;
8. The last sentence is too lengthy and incorrect grammatically. Advise you to rephrase it&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps! 🙂&lt;br&gt;The line graph depicts the intake of three different spreads(butter, margarine and low fat &amp; reduced spreads) in grams over two and a half decades from 1981 to 2007.&lt;br&gt;
At the outset, it is evident that both margarine and butter consumption have declined over the said period, with the butter experiencing a steep fall.The popularity of butter was replaced by margarine in the 90’s, which then gave way for low fat &amp; reduced foods in the later years (2001).&lt;br&gt;
The butter consumption reached an all time high in 1986 to as high as 160gms from the initial 140gms in 2001. However, this hike was followed by a rapid and a consistent downfall to 50gms in 2007. Although margarine followed the same course, it  fluctuated initially to reach a maximum of 100gms in 1991  and remained stable over the next five years.Thereafter, it gradual dipped to  40gms by 2007 .&lt;br&gt;
Conversely, the intake of low fat &amp; reduced foods began at a meagre 10 gms in 1996. Figures  peaked by 2001 over 80 grams with a marginal decrease afterwards.&lt;br&gt;IELTS-5     Writing Task-1&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the trend of old people (≥65years) living in Japan, Sweden and USA over a century starting from 1940.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it is evident that initially USA had the highest number of people aging 60 and above, followed by Sweden and then Japan. Supposedly, in 2040 Japan will come on the top.&lt;br&gt;
It can be seen that Japan had the least percentage of old people (5%), which were lower than Sweden and USA. It decreased further over the next two decades until 1980. After that the percentage started to rise gradually and reached 10. The following year experienced a sharp jump from 10 to 25%, thus Japan overtaking Sweden and USA after 2020.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, Sweden and USA saw a similar trend of increasing percentage of people aged 65 and above. There were many fluctuations with Sweden surpassing USA just before 2000, finally reaching at 25% in 2040. Meanwhile USA stood just below Sweden.&lt;br&gt;WORDS: 155&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz, can i please get a review on this?&lt;br&gt;
The graph illustrates the consumption of 3 spreads (margarine, low fat and reduced spreads and butter) between 1981 and 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the consumption of margarine and butter seemed to have reduced over the years while the consumption of low fat and reduced spreads increased.&lt;br&gt;
In 1981, butter was the most famous spread used by consumers, followed by margarine, while low fat spreads weren’t even introduced yet. This value changes over the years and in 2007, low fat and reduced spreads became the most famous spreads used by people.&lt;br&gt;
The consumption of butter has decreased over the years, starting at just above 140 grams in 1981, reaching a peak of 160 grams in 1986, but then having a great fall to reach a low of about 50 grams in 2007. On the other hand, margarine consumption started at about 90 grams in 1981, this value stays almost steady, although with a few fluctuations, until 2001 when there was a significant drop in its consumption to about 40 grams.&lt;br&gt;
Low fat and reduced spreads were introduced in 1996 starting at just about 5 grams i 1996, and rising to over 80 grams in 2001, these were in great favour of the public. This value drops to about 50 grams in 2007, but they were still the most used of all 3 spreads that year.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
thank you for all the good work you are doing and the amount and quality of material you provide. 🙂 Just a quick question, although it may have been answered before. I’m taking a computer-based test and I was wondering about the structure of the paragraphs in the written tasks. I know that there should not be any gaps in the beginning of the paragraphs or on the left side of the text, but what about the right side? Should I choose it to be the same or do you think this will affect in any way the presentation of my essay? Thank you in advance :))&lt;br&gt;As you see, I write my model answers on a laptop. Follow the way I present paragraphs 🙂&lt;br&gt;The line graph illustrates the usage of Magarine, Low fat and reduced spreads and butter over the period of continuous twenty six years starting from 1981.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, consumption of Magarine and Butter decreased while use of Low fat and reduced spreads has increased.&lt;br&gt;
In 1986 Butter was able to marked the highest consumption over the considered period which was 160 grams in number. It has decreased dramatically by the rest of the period.&lt;br&gt;
Although, within first five years, consumption of the Magarine has fall down its usage was increased at two-fold rate within next five years. From 1991 to 1996 it was stable and then its demand was lowered very sharply and by the end of the period it was the lowest consumed spread.&lt;br&gt;
Low fat and reduced spreads seemed had a high demand over first five years, starting from 1996 and was able reached to the level of Magarine which was at the top at that time. After 2001 people interest to it too has fell down as same as other two and was 70grams in 2007, marking it as the top most consumed spread at the end period.&lt;br&gt;
(Report ends.)&lt;br&gt;
192 words&lt;br&gt;Is this work suit for get band score 7.0 ?&lt;br&gt;The consumption in grams of three different spreads namely: margarine, low fat and reduced spreads, and butter for 26 years is illustrated in the line graph.&lt;br&gt;
Although the utilization of the spread, specifically the butter was greatly used from 1981 to 1900 reaching up to nearly 160 grams, its consumption never been the same after 1990. The consumptions since after the said year have continuously dropped until 2007. Similarly, the used of low fat and reduces spreads hiked up in the year 2001 reaching just over 80 grams and slightly yet consistently decreased over time.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, the utilization of margarine has a different trend, it started with over 95 grams in the starting years then had a slight decreased by 1986, then it gradually increases up to 100 grams and stayed with same measure over 6 years from 1991 until 1996, from that year little by little the consumption rate dropped to 40 grams in the year 2007.&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
I want to ask that if we start our introduction writing  ‘a glance at the line graph or  given is line graph illustrating smth’ , does it bring higher score? What about using inversion in overview, body part? Thanks in advance&lt;br&gt;No, it doesn’t help your score at all. Using “AT a glance” is actually completely inappropriate considering you are supposed to analyse and not glance at the chart. Just stick to the standard language for report writing. Task 1 is formulaic and can be easily learned.&lt;br&gt;Does the overview have to start with ‘Overall’ ?&lt;br&gt;The examiner is looking for appropriate and logical linking words – this is the most logical and most appropriate way to start an overview. Why would you not want to use it?&lt;br&gt;I had gone through many ieltes coaching websites but yours is the best .I am starting to learn using this.Thank u so much&lt;br&gt;I’m glad my site is helping you 🙂&lt;br&gt;Dear Liz,I am your big fan&lt;br&gt;
Your explanation and sentences are excellent and you are my master&lt;br&gt;
I love you&lt;br&gt;I’m glad my website is useful for you 🙂&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
In all your sample writing tasks the first sentence says illustrates. can we use elucidates or exhibits instead of illustrates?&lt;br&gt;Why do you want to change the word? You only need to write one report in the test. IELTS usually use “gives information about” and you paraphrase as “illustrates” – nothing more is needed. Don’t give yourself extra work for no reason when you prepare for IELTS. There are many more important aspects to learn and prepare for.&lt;br&gt;I agree , what i understand after following the way you explain the things (which is amazing) , we need to learn the basic about representing the information.  going for extra attractive words can make the things more complicated&lt;br&gt;The graph also has a minor error in that it should say “Low- &amp; reduced-fat spreads,” and not, “Lowfat &amp; reduced spreads,” since “lowfat” is not recognized by any dictionary as a single word and “reduced spreads” is really more of a concept than a thing that actually exists and whose consumption can be measured. I’d like to get to the bottom of who this “unknown source” is. Just (mostly) kidding. My mom’s an editor and I can’t help myself. More importantly, I love this site! It’s a huge help with those of my students who are prepping for the IELTS. Thanks, Liz!&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your input, Todd. The problem here is that this is all about IELTS. You can’t alter the category titles given on a graph. You can adapt capital letters to make sentences grammatically correct, but you can’t alter the category headings. Just as you can’t alter data because it doesn’t make logical sense (which has happened in an IELTS graph before – you’d be surprised at what has turned up in IELTS tests). So, for this, candidates must stick with what has been given in the graph and work with it. About the source, there are many IELTS graphs floating around online without a known source of origin – this is one of them. It provides a useful lesson for candidates to see how to tackle a line graph report. Glad you like the site and that it’s helping your students 🙂&lt;br&gt;Your the best teacher&lt;br&gt;Thanks Liz. You are a great teacher.&lt;br&gt;
Bless you.&lt;br&gt;Thanks 🙂&lt;br&gt;Hi, Liz! I am grateful to ensure myself with your materials, posts, suggestions and etc. My question is related to calculation.&lt;br&gt;
1. Units are/were measured in grams…? Are or were? Which one is correct? Since, nowadays, such index maybe be measured in another type of calculation. The line graph is given in the past simple. Thanks in advance for your explanation.&lt;br&gt;How the units are measured is always in the present because it refers to what you see rather than the data given in the past. It will always be “Units are measured in …”. However, you only use this if you haven’t already given the units in the previous statement. For example, “The graph illustrates the proportion of …” – this already shows the units are in percentage so you don’t need to repeat it.&lt;br&gt;Hi, Liz! I am grateful to ensure myself with your tips, materials, posts and etc. My question is concerning overview point and the sentence related to calculation.&lt;br&gt;
1. Can I start mine overview like this “Overall, a glance at the graph reveals that…”””&lt;br&gt;
2. The line graph or bar chart is given in thepast simple, for instance in 2000. Under this circumstance, how should I say “”the statistics were/are measured in smth”””” which one is best option were or are?&lt;br&gt;“a glance at the graph” is not recommended to use. Firstly it seems as though you are trying to push unnecessary language into your report, which is supposed to be a highly focused report. Secondly, your task is not to glance but to analyse. Always try to avoid using words that are not necessary – it won’t help your score in IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Thank you so much! I will follow your advice.&lt;br&gt;hi! Liz hope you doing good&lt;br&gt;
i just wanna ask that i have given  IELTS test 3 times and still not getting good bands in reading and writing  i have worked so hard but i m loosing hope for getting good bands and i don’t know my mistakes so what should i do&lt;br&gt;
PLEASE REPLY!&lt;br&gt;Firstly, review your understand of the techniques and requirements of IELTS higher band scores. Unless you understand what the examiner is looking for and what influences your score to go up or down, you won’t improve. You can use my free tips and model essays on this page: &lt;br&gt;. I also offer Advanced Writing Task 2 Lessons which are very detailed and are aimed to help people push their scores higher by explaining step by step how to create a high band score essay: &lt;br&gt;Hi Liz,&lt;br&gt;
     Pls give me a reply.&lt;br&gt;
          For a graph with no dates we use present tense. But if it’s a survey report with no dates??? The survey is done already, then is it past tense or present tense? &lt;br&gt;  I’m totally confused, i don’t have any tutor to ask. Pls give me a reply and thank you in advance&lt;br&gt;If there is any mention that the data in the table, graph, map, chart etc is in the past, you use past tense. If there is no indication, you use the present tense. IELTS is not a trick test. Just apply logic and common sense in all situations. English grammar rules are not different because it is IELTS.&lt;br&gt;Good 👍&lt;br&gt;Hi Liz&lt;br&gt;
why you have not compared the figures through body paragraphs?&lt;br&gt;Because it is not necessary to do so with a line graph. A comparison can be given in the overview. This is similar to diagrams – they frequently do not contain comparisons. You only compare where necessary.&lt;br&gt;Thank You Ma, your website have been of great help to me.&lt;br&gt;
Pls Ma how should i construct the paragraph when writing.&lt;br&gt;
Should i leave a full line and start a new paragraph or should i go to the next line then give a few space before writing.&lt;br&gt;Your aim is to make it easy for the examiner to see your paragraphs. There are no fixed rules on how to do that. Leaving an empty line between paragraphs is the most effective way.",https://ieltsliz.com/ielts-writing-task-1-line-graph-model-score-9/
